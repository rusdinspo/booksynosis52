Barbara had everything she'd ever wanted: five beautiful children, a home, her faith, and a husband named Eli. But while Barbara was happy to live as the Amish have for centuries - without modern conveniences, Eli was tempted by technology: cell phones, the Internet, and sexting. Online he called himself "Amish Stud" and found no shortage of "English" women looking for love and sex. Twice he left Barbara and their children, was shunned, begged for forgiveness, and had been welcomed back to the church. </p><p>Barb Raber was raised Amish, but is now a Conservative Mennonite. She drove Eli to appointments in her car, and she gave him what he wanted when he wanted: a cell phone, a laptop, rides to his favorite fishing and hunting places, and, most importantly, sex. When Eli starts asking people to kill his wife for him, Barb offers to help. One night, just after Eli had hitched a ride with a group of men to go fishing in the hours before dawn, Barb Raber entered the Weaver house and shot Barbara Weaver in the chest at close range.</p><p>It was only the third murder in hundreds of years of Amish life in America, and it fell to Edna Boyle, a young assistant prosecutor to seek justice for Barbara Weaver.</p></p><p><p>A <i>New York Times</i> and USA Today bestselling author, GREGG OLSEN has written several nonfiction books, novels, a novella, and contributed a short story to a collection edited by Lee Child.

The subject of the first essay was John F. Kennedy and his young family, who sat for formal black-and-white portraits just three weeks prior to Kennedy's presidential inauguration. Six images appeared in the magazine's February 1961 issue.</p><p>That same day, Avedon created more informal color portraits of Kennedy and his family at the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach. One of these images ran as the cover of <em>LOOK</em> magazine's February 28 issue, with photographs by Avedon inside. Just before the magazine hit the newsstands and was delivered to over 6.5 million people, a set of photographs, comprised mostly of the <em>LOOK</em> images, was released by the White House and appeared in newspapers across the country.</p><p>During his lifetime, Richard Avedon donated more than two hundred images to the Smithsonian Institution, including all of the photographs of the Kennedy family sitting for <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>. Smithsonian curator Shannon Thomas Perich has culled more than seventy-five images from that donation for <em>The Kennedys: Portrait of a Family</em>, making these stunning photographs available for view for the first time. Perich's introductory essay&#x2014;accompanied by a wealth of archival photographs of both Avedon and the Kennedy family&#x2014;provides historical background on the two sittings within a political and cultural context and critically examines the work of one of the finest photographers of the twentieth century. A foreword by Robert Dallek, distinguished historian and author of the bet-selling <em>An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963</em>, provides authoritative and compelling insight to one of the most fascinating presidents in American history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Love Yourself, and It Doesn&#39;t Matter Who You Marry. Eva-Maria Zurhorst</h2><p>The author shows that a deep relationship is possible even when all hope seems to be lost. Whatever the problem is, the solution lies in finding love for yourself. Her powerful techniques and ideas will change the way you look at your relationships and yourself forever.</p><p>Eva-Maria Zurhorst was originally a journalist and worked for the print media and radio and as an author in South Africa and Egypt. Later she became a business coach and communications advisor. Today, following training as a psychotherapist, she works as a relationship and career coach with business people, managers and couples. Regardless of the base of the problems, the focus on her work is always the development of love for oneself. She is now a columnist and relationship counsellor for a popular Women&#39;s magazine in Germany and regularly hosts a TV program on relationships. She lives with her husband and daughter in Germany</p><h2>Baptism: My adoption into God&#39;s Family (People&#39;s Bible Teachings)</h2><p>Baptism is not just a church rite that identifies a baptized person as a Christian. It is a mighty act of the triune God in which he washes away sin and creates saving faith, and sinners are born again as children of God and become living members of Christ&#39;s spiritual body, the church. Because Baptism gives and does such great things, it isn&#39;t surprising that it figures prominently in the New Testament. Baptism, of the People&#39;s Bible Teachings series, presents what the Bible teaches about Baptism and its meaning for the Christian&#39;s everyday life of faith. The book also discusses such practices as infant Baptism and custom of baptismal sponsors.</p><p></p><h2>The Candy Witch</h2><p>softcover</p><p></p><h2>Guide to Weather Forecasting: All the Information You&#39;ll Need to Make Your Own Weather Forecast (Firefly Pocket series)</h2><p><p><i><b>A concise guide to weather systems and weather forecasting.</b></i></p> <p>As recent events have shown, weather can have very different consequences depending on where you live. <i>b&gt;Guide to Weather Forecasting</i> covers every aspect of making a forecast and is a handy resource to understanding the professionals' daily weather predictions.</p> <p>Storm Dunlop provides detailed information and expert explanations, including:</p> <li>What causes weather<br> </li><li>Weather systems and how they change<br> </li><li>Recognizing clouds and sky appearance<br> </li><li>Weather conditions, such as depressions, lows and highs, wind systems and direction, dew point, humidity, visibility, frost, anticyclones and snow<br> </li><li>The readings meteorologists use when developing a forecast<br> </li><li>Extreme weather and climate change<p></p> <p><b><i>Guide to Weather Forecasting</i></b> also covers charts, satellite images and instruments that can be used at home.

Forecasting the weather requires a knowledge of the situation over a large area 'upwind' (so to speak) of the area in which you are interested. To forecast just one day ahead, professional weather forecasters in Europe, for example, need to know what is happening right across the Atlantic. Similarly, forecasters on the West Coast of North America require details of the situation across the Pacific as far as Japan. In preparing forecasts for three days ahead, forecasters need detailed information about conditions across the whole Earth, including data from the southern hemisphere and Antarctica. An understanding of the basic mechanisms driving the weather is extremely helpful for predicting what is going to happen on even a local scale. </p><p><b> The structure of the atmosphere </b></p><p> Most weather phenomena, including the majority of clouds, occur in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere. This is extremely thin compared with the size of the Earth, which has an equatorial diameter of 7,926 mi (12,756 km) and 7,900 ml (12,714 km) measured across the poles. Yet the troposphere extends to about 11-12 mi (18-20 km) at the most (in the equatorial regions) and to just about 4.3 mi (7 km) at the poles. The level of the top of the troposphere, called the tropopause, is defined by a change in the way the temperature behaves with increasing altitude. Between the surface and the tropopause the temperature generally decreases with height -- albeit often in an irregular manner. The changes in temperature with height are extremely important for the formation of clouds, as we shall see later (p.24). </p><p> At the tropopause, the decline ceases, and the temperature tends to remain constant in the lowest region of the next layer, the stratosphere (p.5). It then starts to increase with height, reaching a maximum at an altitude of about 31 mi (50 km). This heating in the stratosphere is the result of the absorption of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by molecules of ozone whose greatest concentration occurs at about 12-15.5 mi (20-25 km). The destruction of this ozone by manmade chemicals has led to the formation of the seasonal 'ozone holes' over the Antarctic and Arctic regions. There are few clouds in the stratosphere, although sometimes there are ice-crystal clouds in the lowermost region, including, on rare occasions, beautiful nacreous clouds (pp.51 -2). </p><p> At the top of the stratosphere, at the stratopause, which lies at an altitude of approximately 31 mi (50 km), the temperature again begins to decrease with height within the layer known as the mesosphere. The very lowest temperatures in the atmosphere (-260 to -148�F (-163 to -100�C)) are found at the top of the mesosphere, at the mesopause, which is generally at an altitude of about 53 mi (86 km) (or roughly 62 mi (100 km) over the polar regions in summer). Conditions in the mesosphere have no direct effect on the weather down at the surface, but the highest clouds in the atmosphere, noctilucent clouds (pp.52-3), occur just below the mesopause and are sometimes visible from high latitudes, in summer, in the middle of the night. </p><p> Above the mesosphere lies the outermost layer of the atmosphere, the thermosphere. The uppermost region of the mesosphere and lowest part of the thermosphere (between 40 and 620 mi (60 and 1,000 km), approximately) is also known as the ionosphere. Although this region is significant for communications because of its effects on radio waves, and is also the site of the aurorae, it, and the thermosphere in general, have little direct effect on the weather at surface level. </p></p><h2>The Second Coming: Signs of Christ&#39;s Return and the End of the Age</h2><p>Used.

He's strong, energertic, in constant motion, and loves the ocean, thus living up to his name, Riptide. He's a terror on the beach, a pest to sunbathers, and an annoyance to the beach patrol.

But what does it mean?<p></p><p>Arguably the most significant scientific discoveru of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life.</p><p>Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Matt Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome. It will help you understand what this scientific milestone means for you, for your children, and for humankind.</p></p><p>Science writer Matt Ridley has found a way to tell someone else's story without being accused of plagiarism. <i>Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters</i> delves deep within your body (and, to be fair, Ridley's too) looking for dirt dug up by the Human Genome Project. Each chapter pries one gene out of its chromosome and focuses on its role in our development and adult life, but also goes further, exploring the implications of genetic research and our quickly changing social attitudes toward this information. <i>Genome</i> shies away from the "tedious biochemical middle managers" that only a nerd could love and instead goes for the A-material: genes associated with cancer, intelligence, sex (of course), and more.<p> Readers unfamiliar with the jargon of genetic research needn't fear; Ridley provides a quick, clear guide to the few words and concepts he must use to translate hard science into English. His writing is informal, relaxed, and playful, guiding the reader so effortlessly through our 23 chromosomes that by the end we wish we had more. He believes that the Human Genome Project will be as world-changing as the splitting of the atom; if so, he is helping us prepare for exciting times--the hope of a cure for cancer contrasts starkly with the horrors of newly empowered eugenicists. Anyone interested in the future of the body should get a head start with the clever, engrossing <i>Genome</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>Matt Ridley is the award-winning, bestselling author of several books, including&nbsp;<em>The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves</em>; <em>Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters</em>; and <em>The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature</em>.

Now she's a Fleet captain with one regret: not enough pirates.</p></p><p>Anne McCaffrey is the author of the much-loved Dragonriders of Pern series. Brought up in the US, she currently lives in Ireland. Elizabeth Moon served as a 1st Lieutenant in the US Marine Corps and is the author of the Deed of Paksenarrion series. She lives in Texas.The first in the Planet Pirates series, this science fiction yarn offers a vivid universe inhabited by cardboard citizens. Sassinak, the heroine and the only developed character, steps straight from a formula: When she is 12, pirates raid her native colony, enslaving her and g murdering her family. Abe, a fellow captive, befriends her and, when they are emancipated by Fleet (the military), becomes her guardian until he is slain in a barroom brawl. Intelligent and daring, Sass joins Fleet, seeking vengeance on her enemies. She becomes the classic fictional commander: a loner whose entire life is subsumed by the military. Fortunately, Sass's exploits are so expertly recounted that their intrigue and adventure compensate for the hackneyed plot line. Cleverly drawn aliens, supporting characters here, allow the authors to explore various aspects of prejudice. Sass's appraisal of men, however, verges at times on sexist. Hugo winner McCaffrey's works include Dragonsdawn ; Moon is the author of Oath of Gold.

Against overwhelming odds, they created a nation, defended an empire, and voiced ideals that inspire us to this day. In THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, historian T. J. Stiles tells that remarkable story through the words of those who lived it. Stiles, author of the award-winning JESSE JAMES: LAST REBEL OF THE CIVIL WAR, brings together contemporary letters, diaries, and essays that capture both the impassioned arguments and dramatic events. These first-person accounts, woven together with Stiles&#39;s own fast-moving narrative, provide a beginning-to-end history of the Revolution, from the first murmuring of dissent, to the roar of the battlefield, to the final dipomacy that concluded the War of Independence.

In the ones we include here, you&#39;ll meet the saint who spent seven Easters on a whale&#39;s back and the amiable lion who was St. Jerome&#39;s friend. You&#39;ll see St. George fight the dragon, and you&#39;ll read about the fierce wolf St. Francis of Assisi converted. But many of these stories have in them scarcely a wave of the fairy wand. So you&#39;ll also find here true tales of great saints such as St. Louis of France, St. Vincent de Paul, St. Francis Xavier, and St. Elizabeth of Hungary - souls marked by courage, kindness, and piety. These marvelous legends and exciting true stories of Christian saints and heroes will provide many hours of delightful reading to believers and non-believers alike!</p><p>Andrew Lang was a journalist, poet, editor, literary critic, and translator, and historian. Born in Scotland in 1844, he studied at St. Andrews University and at Balliol College, Oxford. Lang spent much of his life in London, writing for the Morning Post and for the Daily News, and working as the literary editor of Longman&#x2019;s Magazine. Lang wrote novels and works of poetry, many books on religion and culture, and even translated the Iliad and the Odyssey. By the time of his death in 1912, Andrew Lang was widely known as a versatile, prodigious scholar. But today, Lang is remembered not so much for his scholarship as for the many fine collections of legends and stories he compiled with the assistance of Lenora, his wife. The Book of Saints and Heroes is one of the best of them.</p><h2>Greek and Roman Mythology (World History)</h2><p>Examines the historical development of Greco-Roman mythology, its heroes, and its influence on the history of Western civilization</p><p>Grade 5-8ATwo worthwhile series entries that are clearly and concisely written. Black-and-white illustrations enhance the texts, and the sidebars are informative and interesting. Mythology condenses well-known tales such as Cyclops and Oedipus, starting with the creation of the Gods. It explains what myths are and where they come from, how they were an integral part of the early Greek and Roman cultures, and how that has changed. Science explains the basis for modern scientific thought, including what it is and where it began. Nardo gives a brief description of the beginnings of writing, math, medicine, and astronomy. He covers an earlier time period than that found in most juvenile sources such as Ray Spangenburg's The History of Science (Facts On File, 1993) and caters to a much broader age range.

Newspaper editor Joshua Crawford has put his life on hold until he can expose the lies that this Morgan fellow has written about the beloved, saintly grandfather who raised him. Once Daphne meets Joshua, it takes a while for her to decide to acknowledge her secret identity. After all, no proper lady would dare pen dime novels in 1918. But when Daphne discovers how serious Joshua is about clearing his grandfather&#x2019;s name, and how important it is to him, she tells the truth about her alter ego and accompanies Joshua on a fact-finding mission.

(<i>Booklist</i>)</p><h2>Sky Masters</h2><p>A confrontation between the People&#39;s Republic of China and the United States over an oil-rich chain of islands in the South China Sea erupts into all-out war</p><p>Dale Brown was a much decorated US Air Force Captain aboard B-52s and FB111 fighter bombers, and participated in numerous top secret tests and exercises held to simulate an actual strategic war. He became a recognised expert on air warfare and appeared on American TV as a commentator during the Gulf War. Only a man with Dale Brown&#39;s background could provide the detailed authenticity that makes his novels such compulsive reading.War erupts almost immediately when America pulls out of the Philippines and China slips in to fill the power vacuum. A few of the characters flying Brown's gadget-filled war planes previously appeared in Day of the Cheetah (1989). Glossary entries (176) and a warm dedication to strategic air power generalissimo Curtis LeMay accurately signal the approach of a superacronymic, high-tech military adventure. The casus belli this time is Chinese enforcement of that country's ancient claim to the Spratly Islands--a tiny, uninhabitable, barely visible, mineral-rich chain halfway between the Asian mainland and the Philippines. The Philippines, at last free of their long-term American tenants, also claim the Spratlys, and a shootout in the atoll between the two Asian nations' navies escalates much too quickly into full-scale war as the Chinese, led by a maniacal admiral, pop off a small nuclear device and then take the opportunity to invade the Philippine mainland--where the leftist first vice-president in the coalition government is only too happy to welcome them. A very unhappy American government has to throw together a battle plan on very short notice, but thanks to the inventive skills of the military-industrial complex's most talented techno-weenie, the Air Force has use of a new generation of spy satellites that, when paired with a souped-up B-2 Stealth bomber turns the air war into an immense video game. Genuinely exciting fight scenes are swamped by oceans of technical detail of interest primarily to the pencil-protector crowd. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel &#34;stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity.&#34; N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its &#34;profound vitality.&#34; It is this profound vitality in Turgenev&#39;s characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.<b>Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev</b> was born in Orel in 1818 and was educated at the universities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 1839 he went to study at the University of Berlin, where he acquired the Western values for which he was much criticized in Russia throughout his life. His relationship with the opera singer Pauline Viardot caused his tyrannical mother to cut off his funds, and he lived as a Bohemian until her death in 1850 made him a rich man. His first successful novel,<i> A Sportsman&#x2019;s Sketches </i>(1852), was a sympathetic picture of Russian peasants and a condemnation of serfdom; it was widely believed to have contributed to the Tsar&#x2019;s decision to emancipate the serfs, much as <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> was said to influence the emancipation of the American slaves. In the following productive decade, Turgenev published <i>Rudin </i>(1856),<i> A Nest of Gentlefolk</i> (1858), <i>On the Eve</i> (1860), <i>First Love</i> (1860), and <i>Fathers and Sons</i> (1862)&#x2014;all of which drew critics&#x2019; applause. His liberal views were politically suspect, however, and he chose to live the rest of his life in France. His novels <i>Smoke</i> (1867) and <i>Virgin Soil</i> (1877) show the depth of his bitterness, but his last visit to Russia in 1880 marked a triumphant homecoming. He died in 1883, at Bougival, near Paris. <br><br><b>Jane Costlow </b>is Professor of Russian at Bates College, where she holds the Christian A. Johnson Chair of Interdisciplinary Studies.

She has been hailed by <i>Rendezvous</i> magazine as an author whose &#x201c;larger than life heroes and heroines make you believe all the warm, wonderful, wild things in life.&#x201d;<br><br>Sexy, funny, and wonderfully romantic, here is the unforgettably sensuous story of a woman too smart to fall in love &#x2014; and the man determined to prove her wrong.<br><br><b>Thursday&#x2019;s Child<br></b><br>Allison Leamon knew that pretending to be her identical twin sister was a bad idea. For although the two redheads looked exactly alike, they couldn&#x2019;t be more different. How could a no-nonsense scientist like Allison possibly fool anyone into thinking that she was the bubbly, vivacious Annie?<br><br>Trading her sensible shoes for strappy sandals, her eyeglasses for contacts, and her lab smock for a chiffon dress, Allison was determined to try her best. Her first challenge was a dinner date with Annie&#x2019;s fianc�, Davis. But what Allison didn&#x2019;t expect was the presence of Davis&#x2019;s best friend. <br><br>Allison was far too logical to believe in love at first sight, but there was nothing logical about the way she was responding to Spencer Raft. The dark-haired, blue-eyed mystery man had an assurance that Allison found positively maddening.<br><br>And by the end of the evening, she couldn&#x2019;t help feeling that Spencer had been attracted to a carefully constructed illusion. She was certain that the handsome adventurer wouldn&#x2019;t give her a second look if he knew her as she really was.<br><br>But Spencer Raft was a man of many talents &#x2014; and seeing below the surface of things was one of them. He sensed the flesh-and-blood woman beneath the elaborate charade, and after years of wandering the world in search of excitement, he knew he had finally found what he had been looking for.<br><br>But first this incurable romantic had to convince an intractable skeptic that there was more to love than what she could study in a laboratory. And what better way than to propose a passionate experiment of his own?<br><br>On board his yacht, Spencer and Allison would fulfill their wildest fantasies and deepest desires; but when their blissful idyll was over, would it all prove to be no more than a pleasant interlude &#x2014; or the real thing?</p><p>Sandra Brown began her writing career in 1980. After selling her first book, she wrote a succession of romance novels under several pseudonyms, most of which remain in print. She has become one of the country&#x2019;s most popular novelists, earning the notice of Hollywood and of critics.

We haven&#x2019;t done that since we were children.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we always got away with it.&#x201d;<br><br>Allison Leamon eyed her sister in exasperation. Except for the expression Ann&#x2019;s was expectant, Allison could have been looking at her own reflection.<br><br>Ann was sitting Indian-fashion in the center of her sister&#x2019;s bed. Allison turned her back on Ann and began taking the hairpins from the bun on the back of her head. She shook out a mane of deep auburn hair that fell to her shoulders in thick waves that matched her sister&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Bette Davis has played twins who swapped places in a couple of her movies. Something terrible always happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the movies; this is real life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t art imitate life?&#x201d;<br><br>Ann sighed in vexation. &#x201c;Come on, Allison. Will you or won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re serious about having this operation in the first place,&#x201d; she said, pulling a hairbrush through her hair.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go through the rest of my life flat-chested.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not flat-chested,&#x201d; Allison argued, assessing her own figure in the mirror.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not overly endowed either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who wants to be? They&#x2019;ll just sag in a few years, then you&#x2019;ll wish you didn&#x2019;t have them.&#x201d; Laying the brush on the vanity, she turned to Ann. &#x201c;Please reconsider, Annie. Don&#x2019;t do this.&#x201d;<br><br>Ann laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always so damned cautious and practical. Don&#x2019;t you ever have one frivolous thought? Just look at yourself now that you&#x2019;ve let your hair down. You&#x2019;re gorgeous. Don&#x2019;t you want to be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not gorgeous. And no, I don&#x2019;t particularly want to be. Looks aren&#x2019;t important.&#x201d;<br><br>Ann pressed a hand over her heart and addressed the ceiling. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said theatrically, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s what a person is like on the inside that counts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make fun of me all you want, but that&#x2019;s the way I feel. I&#x2019;d much rather be considered intelligent than a knockout.&#x201d;<br><br>Ann frowned in aggravation. Her sister was hopeless. All Allison cared about was her laboratory, her electron microscope, her Bunsen burner, any old organisms that could be cultivated in a petri dish! &#x201c;Are you going to do me this favor or not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. I don&#x2019;t want any part of it. Why can&#x2019;t Davis know beforehand?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I want it to be a surprise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He likes you the way you are. Why else would he be marrying you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know one man who wouldn&#x2019;t like his woman to have large breasts?&#x201d; The moment the question left her lips, Ann began shaking her head. &#x201c;Forget it. I withdraw the question. You don&#x2019;t know any men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know quite a few men,&#x201d; Allison said loftily.<br><br>&#x201c;And they&#x2019;re all brainy and weird!&#x201d; Ann shot back.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re scientists.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As I said, brainy and weird,&#x201d; Ann mumbled as she plucked at a loose thread on Allison&#x2019;s bedspread. The sulking lasted only a few moments before she lost her patience. &#x201c;I want a breast enlargement. It&#x2019;s for my self-esteem. Davis will go absolutely bananas when he sees the improvement. I&#x2019;m asking my twin sister to help me out a little and she&#x2019;s making a big deal out of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No pun intended, I hope,&#x201d; Allison said dryly. At Ann&#x2019;s fulminating look she relented somewhat. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re hardly asking me to help you out &#x2018;a little.&#x2019; You&#x2019;re asking me to pretend to be you while you sneak off and have the surgery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only for a few days. Only until the bandages come off.&#x201d;<br><br>Allison covered her own breasts, one with each hand, and shuddered. The whole idea repelled her, but it was Ann&#x2019;s business. She only wished Ann hadn&#x2019;t involved her in it. &#x201c;What about your job?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking a week&#x2019;s vacation. No problem there. You&#x2019;ll go to work as usual. It&#x2019;s only in the evenings when you&#x2019;ll need to be with Davis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What will you be doing, hiding in the back bedroom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying in the clinic. It&#x2019;s expensive, but I&#x2019;d rather stay there than at home.&#x201d;<br><br>Allison pushed away from the dresser and began to pace. &#x201c;Annie, this is crazy. You and Davis ... well, doesn&#x2019;t he expect certain, uh, you know...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean bedroom privileges?&#x201d; Allison blushed. Ann laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve covered you on that. I told him the gynecologist changed my birth-control-pill prescription and that we weren&#x2019;t supposed to sleep together for three weeks until we knew they were going to take.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s absurd!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As a biologist in genetics you know that, and as a woman I know that, but Davis doesn&#x2019;t know it. He griped like hell, but he accepted it. So you won&#x2019;t have to worry about him trying to get you into bed. And for crying out loud, it&#x2019;s only for three or four days!&#x201d;<br><br>Allison nervously twisted her hands. Ann had always been able to do this to her, talk her into something common sense warned against. &#x201c;Switching places was an amusing game to play on Mom and Dad, even teachers, but I have a premonition that something dreadful will happen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fatalist. Nothing&#x2019;s going to happen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you want me to move into your condo?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would be the most convenient arrangement. Davis could always find me, or rather you, there.&#x201d;<br><br>What remained unsaid, but understood, was that Allison&#x2019;s absence from her own apartment would go unnoticed. She had no one calling for her in the evenings. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to wear your clothes,&#x201d; she said unenthusiastically.<br><br>&#x201c;Which will be a vast improvement over your wardrobe.&#x201d; Ann eyed Allison&#x2019;s navy dirndl skirt and tailored white blouse with undisguised distaste.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to wear my contacts all the time and they give me a headache.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better a headache than those owlish glasses you wear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And my hair...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will you stop! Your hair looks terrific loose and natural instead of knotted into that old-maid&#x2019;s bun.&#x201d; She hopped off the bed and confronted Allison with both hands on her hips. &#x201c;So will you or won&#x2019;t you? Please, Allison. This is important to me.&#x201d;<br><br>Everything was important to Ann. She lived from crisis to crisis. She didn&#x2019;t do anything by half-measures. She plunged right into every critical event, usually dragging her unwilling, less adventuresome sister right be- hind her.<br><br>Allison turned to the mirror and gazed at her image. Could she pass for Ann? Ann who never met a stranger, but a potential friend? Ann who felt at home in any situation? Ann with the bubbling personality and more charm in her little finger than Allison possessed in her whole body?<br><br>Ann walked over to stand beside her. Since Allison wasn&#x2019;t wearing her glasses, and with her hair curling over her shoulders like Ann&#x2019;s, they were identical.<br><br>And it was only for a few days. And Ann was her twin, her only sibling. And lifetime habits were hard to break.<br><br>Allison smiled wryly. &#x201c;Do you realize that for the rest of our lives people are going to be looking at our boobs in order to tell us apart?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Allison. You&#x2019;ll do it?&#x201d; Ann spun Allison around and gave her an exuberant hug. &#x201c;I knew I could count on you. Here&#x2019;s my engagement ring,&#x201d; she said, twisting it off her finger and putting it on Allison&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t dare lose it. Now let me tell you about tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Davis and I are meeting his best friend for dinner. They grew up together, blood brothers and all that. I&#x2019;ve never met him, and Davis wants to show me off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Annie,&#x201d; Allison wailed.</p><h2>Fortress Rabaul: The Battle for the Southwest Pacific, January 1942-April 1943</h2><p><p>For most of World War II, the mention of Japan's island stronghold sent shudders through thousands of Allied airmen.

But not least it is the home and constant muse of a relatively young art: photography. Since the earliest days of the daguerreotype right up to our time, renowned photographers such as Joseph Nic�phore Niepce, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau, and Jeanloup Sieff have lived and worked in the city of lights. Over the years a love affair developed between Paris and photography, giving rise to a remarkable record of the metropolis and a telling history of a new art form. This volume takes the reader on numerous walks, camera in hand, through the streets of Paris. Atmospheric black-and-white photos, shot by great photographers over two centuries, reveal the dramatic and the tranquil, the historic and the everyday&#x2015;in the capital&#x2019;s parks and gardens, boulevards and backstreets, passages and arcades, bistros and nightclubs.</p><p>Jean Claude Gautrand (1932&#x2013;2019) was one of France&#x2019;s most distinguished experts on photography.

Lough Glass is at the heart and soul of the namesake town clinging to its shore. They say that if you go out on St. Agnes' Eve and look into the lake at sunset you can see your future. But beneath its serene surface, the lake harbors secrets as dark and unfathomable as the beautiful woman who night after night walks beside its waters. Lough Glass is home to Kit McMahon, in a way it will never be to her lovely mother, Helen, who does not fit in with the ways of the people of Lough Glass, and who found an unlikely mate in the genial pharmacist Martin McMahon. Kit adores her mother, but can't escape the picture of her, alone at the kitchen table, tears streaming down her face... or walking alone by the glass lake. Then one terrible night Martin's boat is found drifting upside down in the lake. The night Helen is lost. The night Kit discovers a letter on Martin's pillow and burns it, unopened, in the grate. The night everything changes forever.</p><p>In the tradition of her beloved novel Circle of Friends, Irish novelist Maeve Binchey offers a wonderful old-fashioned melodrama with a contemporary cast of compelling characters.

So when France sold Iraq a top-of-the-line nuclear reactor in 1975, the Israelis were justifiably concerned&#x2014;especially when they discovered that Iraqi scientists had already formulated a secret program to extract weapons-grade plutonium from the reactor, a first critical step in creating an atomic bomb. The reactor formed the heart of a huge nuclear plant situated twelve miles from Baghdad, 1,100 kilometers from Tel Aviv. By 1981, the reactor was on the verge of becoming &#x201c;hot,&#x201d; and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin knew he would have to confront its deadly potential.

In an ironically unconscious homage, Saddam Hussein, who didn't know Tamerlane from Timbuktu, would one day commission his own public sculpture in Baghdad featuring two gigantic arms bursting through the sand brandishing a pair of crossed scimitars that crowned a similar pyramid of skulls fashioned from the helmets of thousands of slaughtered twentieth-century Persian soldiers, known now in modern times as Iranians.<br><br>It was into this savagely unforgiving desert that young Saddam, whose name in Arabic means to "strike" or "punch," was thrust on April 28, 1937, fatherless and penniless, to be reared in a mud-and-straw house on the kiln-hot banks of the Tigris, without electricity, running water, or paved roads. Hussein would never forget his Tikriti roots. As though drawing inspiration from the land itself, he was mesmerized as a village boy by the country's ancient glory when it sat at the head of the Fertile Crescent, long before Abraham marched south from Ur in northern Mesopotamia to lay claim to the tribal homeland of the Semites. Much more than Iraq's later Islamic heritage, divided between the Sunni sects of the north and Shia of the south, Saddam identified with the country's pre-Arab Babylonian roots. He revered the great Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, whose golden age of prosperity had transformed ancient Baghdad into an intellectual center of trade and the arts, renowned throughout the Old World for such wonders as its legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Even more impressive to young Saddam, Nebuchadnezzar was the last Middle Eastern ruler to conquer the Jews. Following a revolt in Palestine in 587 b.c., Nebuchadnezzar's army had destroyed Jerusalem, razing the First Temple and bringing an end to the kingdom of Judea. Thousands of Jews were marched in bondage back to Mesopotamia in what would become known in Talmudic history as the Babylonian captivity.<br><br>Hussein loved to recount the historic event to colleagues. And he would boast that someday he would follow in the footsteps of the legendary king to rule both the Middle East and Israel. Indeed, years later, after he had assumed regal-like powers, Hussein would embark on a Baghdad beautification program of public artworks, broad boulevards, and thousands of transplanted palm trees meant to evoke the great age of Nebuchadnezzar. Hussein named his sons Udai and Qusai, not names associated with Mohammed but with pre-Islamic Mesopotamia.<br><br>Maintaining fantastic dreams was especially important to young Saddam, who found his own reality nearly unbearable. Iraq was a tangled nation of tribes and clans and ethnic divisions. Where one was born and to what clan, or extended family, was extremely important, even in the poorer classes of Iraqi society. Surnames often derived from the village of one's clan. Most families could trace their forbears back for generations. Saddam's parents were not particularly distinguished members of either of their clans. Al Auja and Tikrit were considered backward, rural villages, and Tikritis of little account. Saddam's father's clan, the al-Majid, was considered lower caste.<br><br>Whether dead or just plain deadbeat--no one has ever seemed able to say for sure--Saddam's biological father left his son to be raised by his mother, Sabha, of the Tikriti Talfah clan, and a series of uncles, including one from his father's al-Majid clan named Ibrahim Hassan, who, regrettably, was better known to locals as "Hassan the Liar." (Tellingly, Saddam Hussein ultimately took his name from neither family--Talfah or Hassan.) Ibrahim eventually married Sabha and, with no trade and plenty of time, amused himself by beating young Saddam with a stick whenever he was bored, which, unfortunately for the boy, was often. He grew up mostly alone, forbidden to play with the other villagers, whom his uncle called "brigands," and who, in return, would taunt him for not having a "real" father. Saddam pined for the day he could escape Tikrit for a better world--a Mesopotamian world. In the meantime he bided his time, spending most days sitting by the side of the dirt road at the head of the village next to a fire pit with a red-hot poker, which he would stab into the stomachs of hapless village dogs that wandered by. This early cruel streak might have been occasion for worry, but on the sun-blasted streets of dirt-poor Tikrit it hardly went noticed.<br><br>Saddam finally caught a break when, in the fall of 1955, his mother's more prosperous brother, Khairallah Talfah, an ex-army officer turned hotheaded Arab nationalist and teacher, took Hussein along with his own son to Baghdad to attend secondary school. Saddam had just turned eighteen. Baghdad would change him forever.<br><br>In the early 1950s the city was a hotbed of ethnic and political radicalism. Iraq, which in Arabic means "the edge," was an amalgam of deeply divided tribes and ethnicities, the remnant of the defunct Ottoman Empire and Britain's Central Asian empire, which, following World War I, had been carved up into Iran and Iraq without taking into account traditionally and ethnically bound territories. Thus, most of southern Iraq, nearly 100 percent Shi'ite, had more in common with Iran than its Sunni "brothers" in the north. In fact, Iranian Shi'ites still revered two southern Iraqi cities as sacred religious shrines, including Najaf, the burial place of Mohammed's son-in-law, Al, (and the site of the horrendous terrorist bombing of its ancient mosque in August 2003). Meanwhile, distrustful of both the ruling Sunni and the southern Shi'ites were the northern Kurds, who were far closer in history and culture to the Kurdish tribes across the border in Turkey. By the 1950s Baghdad's tangle of ethnic divisions was further complicated by a slew of competing political parties, ranging from the Hashemite monarchists (the royal Arab family that ruled Jordan and whose scion, Prince Faisal, Britain had elected to rule Iraq in its stead), the right-wing Independence Party, and the centrist Liberal Party to the leftist People's Party, the Communist Party, and the secretive, socialist Arab nationalist Ba'th, or "Renaissance," Party.<br><br>Despite tutoring by his uncle, Saddam found it difficult to shed his peasant roots in the class-conscious big city, especially the crude accent that marked a rural Tikriti as unmistakably as a Cockney in St. James's Court. He failed to pass the entrance exam to join the prestigious Baghdad Military Academy. The stigma of outcast propelled Hussein, along with many of the city's disenchanted youth, toward the young, rebellious, socialist Ba'th Party. Founded in Damascus by two Syrian intellectuals in the early 1940s, the organization espoused vaguely pan-Arab nationalist and socialist principles similar to Egyptian president Gamal Nasser's Arab Legion. But the party's immediate attraction to Baghdad's frustrated young rebels was its intense hatred of Western colonialism, especially what it saw as its expansionist guerrilla state--Israel.<br><br>Hussein hagiographies would later attribute his party association to his newfound belief in Islamic nationalism. In truth, the impressionable peasant's son was greatly influenced by his uncle Khairallah, who having been jailed by the British for his part in Baghdad's short-lived pro-Mussolini revolt in 1941, was the closest thing Saddam had to a hero. Khairallah mentored him in the tradecraft of Iraqi politicians: manipulation, intrigue, and anti-Semitism. Not one for mincing words, Khairallah's collective wisdom would later be published for the benefit of future Ba'thi in his book Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews, and Flies.<br><br>Hanging around political meetings and outdoor rallies, Saddam eventually caught the attention of Ba'thist officials, who spotted a use for the young man's brooding, sadistic personality. They soon put him in charge of recruiting schoolmates and organizing local street bullies into brownshirtlike gangs to intimidate shopkeepers and the suburban middle class. Saddam became a familiar figure at Ba'th street demonstrations and public beatings, where he would stand off to the side, ordering his thug warriors into the fray or pointing out local tradesmen to be beaten. Things changed radically on July 14, 1958, when Gen. Abdul Karim Qassem and his "Free Officers" Brigade, backed by the Ba'th Party, marched into Baghdad and overthrew King Faisal and the fading Hashemite monarchy. It was a remarkably vicious coup, even by Iraqi standards, the carnage sinking to a new nadir when wild-eyed, rampaging mobs--waving sticks and swords and rushing up and down alleys looking for people to punish--discovered the whereabouts of the body of the just-murdered prime minister Nuri al-Said. The crowd promptly dug up the corpse and dragged it through the streets of Baghdad on a rope. (The scene would ironically be reenacted, at least symbolically, forty-five years later when, at the end of the Iraq War, Baghdad mobs, unable to find the real, live Saddam, made do by pulling down the famed statue of their erstwhile leader and then dragging it through the streets at the end of a rope.) Indeed, Saddam watched this day from the sidelines, but the rising twenty-one-year-old politico could not help but learn a valuable lesson he would not soon forget about the true nature of power in Iraq--and the loss of it.<br>One year later Saddam found himself waiting on a darkening Baghdad street not far from the West German embassy.

Contact Marie at marie@marieforce.com.On the night before she was due to return to work. Lieutenant Sam Holland lay awake watching the bedside clock count down to midnight, the hour she'd officially be back on call. Five minutes to go. Sam had expected to be itching to get back to work after two weeks of constant togetherness with her new husband, U.S. Senator Nick Cappuano. But as the final minutes of their blissful interlude slipped away, she was filled with despair, wondering when they'd ever get that much time alone together again.<br><br>"What's the matter, babe?" he asked from behind her.<br><br>Sam used to hate sharing a bed, and now she couldn't imagine sleeping without his strong arms around her. Conceding defeat to the clock, she turned over and snuggled into his chest. "I'm not ready to go back to work."<br><br>"You've got a few hours yet."<br><br>"Is it after midnight?"<br><br>He raised himself up to peer over her shoulder. "One minute past."<br><br>"They can call me in anytime now."<br><br>"Maybe you'll get lucky and the criminals will take a night off."<br><br>"Let's hope so." She pressed a kiss to one of his well-defined pectorals, and slipped an arm around him. "You've totally ruined me, you know."<br><br>"How's that?"<br><br>"Before this, before us, I used to hate vacations. They'd make me take one twice a year whether I wanted to or not, and the whole time I'd be bored and jonesing to get back to work. But now..."<br><br>"I feel the same way." He tipped her chin up and kissed her. "We've got much better things to do than work."<br><br>"Exactly." She gave herself over to the kiss, powerless to resist him even though they'd both be tired in the morning if they didn't get some sleep. The trip home from their honeymoon in Bora Bora had left them jetlagged.<br><br>Without breaking the kiss, he shifted on top of her.<br><br>"Nick."<br><br>"Hmm?"<br><br>"We already did this tonight&#x2014;twice if I recall correctly," she reminded him, as he trailed kisses from her jaw to her collarbone.<br><br>"Is there a daily sex limit law on the books?"<br><br>"Not that I'm aware of."<br><br>"Then shut up and kiss me."<br><br>She was still laughing when her cell phone rang, making them moan with dismay.<br><br>"Ignore it," he said, capturing her lips for another kiss.<br><br>That she was half-tempted to pretend she hadn't heard the phone was so wildly out of character it scared her. Clearly, she'd gone soft in the head since she got married. "Let me go, Senator. Back to reality."<br><br>"Don't wanna," he said as he released her.<br><br>Sam grabbed the phone from the bedside table and flipped it open. For the first time in two weeks, she said, "Lieutenant Holland."<br><br>"Lieutenant," the dispatcher said, "I was told you're back on duty as of midnight."<br><br>Since Nick was awake anyway, Sam turned on the light and reached for the pad and pen she kept handy. "That's correct."<br><br>"We have a report of a double homicide at Carl's Burger World on Massachusetts Avenue."<br><br>She wrote down the address. "I'll be right there. Can you page Detective Cruz?"<br><br>"Will do."<br><br>Sam ended the call and turned to give Nick a quick kiss. "Sorry."<br><br>"Duty calls," he said with a long-suffering sigh. "What've you got?"<br><br>"A double at Carl's on Mass Ave."<br><br>"I don't know that place."<br><br>"A friend of mine worked there when I was in high school, but I haven't been there in years." She pulled on jeans and a long-sleeved T-shirt since it was still chilly at night. Sitting on Nick's side of the bed, she glanced at him as she put on socks. "Best vacation ever."<br><br>"For me too."<br><br>"We should do it again sometime."<br><br>His face lifted into the sexy half smile she adored.<br><br>"Absolutely."<br><br>Sam tied her sneakers and got up to grab a sweatshirt. In the bedside table drawer, she unlocked the box where she kept the gun, badge and cuffs she hadn't touched in two weeks&#x2014;the longest stretch of time off she'd had since joining the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department twelve years earlier.<br><br>Before leaving the bedroom, she gave her husband one last kiss. "Have a good first day back."<br><br>"You too." He tugged on a strand of her long, toffee-colored hair. "Be careful out there, babe."<br><br>"Always am. See you later." She wasn't even halfway down the stairs before she was hit by the urge to turn around and run back to him. If someone had told her a year ago she'd be so stupidly in love that she'd be mooning over a guy when there were dead bodies to tend to, she probably would've beaten the shit out of the person.<br><br>"I may be stupidly in love," she said as she went out the front door and down the ramp her husband had installed for her paralyzed father, "but it's time to get back to work."<br><br>Sam arrived on the scene at the same time as her partner, Detective Freddie Cruz. He'd donned one of the signature trench coats he claimed were necessary to staying in character and Sam claimed were proof he'd watched too much TV as a kid. He offered her a powdered donut from a six-pack as he jammed another in his mouth.<br><br>Shaking her head, she looked up at him. "Do you buy those things in bulk or something?"<br><br>"Never hurts to be prepared for middle-of-the night calls."<br><br>"I hope I'm around when your metabolism slows down."<br><br>He held up the yellow crime-scene tape for her, and she scooted under it. "Nice to have you back, Lieutenant. I've missed your sparkling wit."<br><br>"I'm back one minute, and you're already sucking up?"<br><br>"I see you still can't take a compliment. Good trip?"<br><br><em>"Great</em> trip. Went by too fast."<br><br>The Patrol officers who'd responded to the initial call showed them to the restaurant's back room, where the sub-zero freezer door was propped open. Inside were two people who looked as if they'd frozen to death.<br><br>"Ugh," said the District's Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Lindsey McNamara, as she joined them. "What a way to go."<br><br>"No kidding," Freddie said, putting the rest of the donuts in his coat pocket. Apparently, he'd lost his appetite.<br><br>"How do we know this is a homicide and not an accident?" Sam asked the Patrol officers.<br><br>"The door locks from the outside," one of them said, pointing to the mangled padlock that had been broken open.<br><br>"Who did that?"<br><br>"The boy's father." The Patrol officer pointed to the young man in the freezer. "Daniel Alvarez, age seventeen. When he didn't come home after work and wasn't answering his phone, his father came looking for him. The door was unlocked, so he came in and found the boy's stuff sitting here on the counter." He pointed to a wallet, keys and cell phone next to an unzipped bank bag that bulged with cash, which ruled out robbery as a motive. "The father went crazy when he saw the lock on the freezer, found a hammer and went to town on it. By the time he got in there it was too late."<br><br>"So not only did he pound the fingerprints off the lock, he probably compromised our crime scene by touching the vics too. Am I right?"<br><br>The patrolmen shuffled from one foot to the other. "Yes, ma'am."<br><br>"Fabulous," Sam muttered as she stepped into the freezer for a closer look at the two victims. She recognized the second one as Carl Olivo, the owner and proprietor. He'd aged since the last time she saw him during her senior year of high school when her friend Melissa had worked for him. Both victims had a bluish tint to their skin, and their eyes were open.<br><br>Freddie grimaced as he squatted for a closer look. "No obvious sign of other trauma."<br><br>"The lack of oxygen in here could've gotten them before the cold did," Lindsey added. "I'll know more after I get them back to the lab."<br><br>Sam studied both victims and took a good look around the freezer. "Go to it," she said to Lindsey. "I'd like to talk to the kid's father."<br><br>"Joseph Alvarez," the patrolman said. "He's outside with Officer Gentile."<br><br>Sam followed the officer through the kitchen and out the back door to an alley behind the restaurant.<br><br>Joseph Alvarez was tall and broad-shouldered, and those broad shoulders were heaving with sobs as Officer Gentile did her best to comfort the grief-stricken man. Looking relieved to see help arriving, she stepped aside to make room for Sam.<br><br>"My only son," Joseph said to no one in particular.<br><br>"My boy."<br><br>Dealing with the families of murder victims was the most difficult part of Sam's job, and it never got any easier. "I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Alvarez."<br><br>"I don't understand. Who would do such a thing to my Daniel? Or Mr. Olivo? Everyone loved them both."<br><br>"Is it possible that another worker locked the freezer without knowing they were in there?" Sam asked, still not entirely convinced this was a homicide.<br><br>He shook his head. "It was only the two of them closing for the night. As soon as I saw Danny's phone sitting on the counter I knew something was wrong. My son is <em>never</em> without that damned phone. I was always after him about it. If he wasn't looking at it between customers at work, it was in his pocket. Someone had to have threatened them to get him into that freezer without his phone."<br><br>"How long after closing did you wait to come check on him?"<br><br>"A couple of hours. They close at nine, and he usually goes out with his friends after. He has to be home by eleven, so when he wasn't home at eleven-thirty and wasn't answering his phone, I came looking for him." Mr. Alvarez rooted around in his shirt pocket and withdrew a pack of cigarettes. His hands shook as he lit one. "I don't know what drew me to the freezer. Just a feeling I had." Shuddering, he broke down again. "I'll never forget seeing the two of them in there."<br><br>"Did you notice if anything in the kitchen area or restaurant was disturbed?"<br><br>He shook his head. "Everything looked normal to me. At first I thought I was losing it for storming down here like an over-protective father, but when I saw that phone...I knew something was really wrong when I saw Danny's phone." Wiping his face, he leaned back against the wall and looked up at the sky. "I lost my wife a year ago. Breast cancer. Danny and I. We were just getting back on track. I can't believe this has happened."<br><br>Moved by his despair and more certain now that this had, in fact, been a homicide, Sam laid a hand on his arm. "We'll do everything we can to find the person who did this." Not that an arrest would bring much comfort, she thought. His son would still be gone forever.<br><br>Nodding, he took another deep drag on his cigarette.<br><br>"Did Danny have trouble with anyone at school or outside of school?"<br><br>"No one. My boy was popular. Everyone loved him. He had a nice girlfriend, lots of good friends. Played sports. A good kid." Joseph gestured to the back door, which was propped open. "This was his first real job."<br><br>"Did he say anything about Mr. Olivo having trouble with anyone?"<br><br>"Not that I ever heard. His wife died last year too. We had that in common. Had a few talks about it here and there while I was in to see Danny at work."<br><br>"Did Mr. Olivo have any other family in the area?"<br><br>"I don't think so. He said something once about his kids being scattered and not getting home much since their mother died. I got the feeling there was some strain between him and the kids. Nothing that would've led to this though."<br><br>"You've been very helpful. Is there someone I could call for you? A family member maybe?"<br><br>He shook his head. "It was just me and Danny. My family's gone, and since my wife died, we haven't seen much of her people."<br><br>"I can't leave you here all alone."<br><br>"I'll call my buddy from work. He'll come get me. Go ahead. I'll be okay."<br><br>Sam needed to get to work figuring out what'd happened here, but a quick glance at Joseph Alvarez's shattered expression told her he was anything but okay.<br><br>Standing next to him, she put her hands in her pockets and leaned against the same wall that propped him up. "I'll wait with you until your friend gets here."</p><h2>Priscilla Alden: And the First Thanksgiving (Let&#39;s Celebrate Series)</h2><p>Describes how Priscilla Alden came to the New World with the other Pilgrims, helped settle the colony of New Plymouth, and celebrated the first Thanksgiving.</p><p></p><h2>Paris in Love: A Memoir</h2><p>In 2009, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Eloisa James took a leap that many people dream about: she sold her house, took a sabbatical from her job as a Shakespeare professor, and moved her family to Paris. <i>Paris in Love: A Memoir</i> chronicles her joyful year in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> With no classes to teach, no committee meetings to attend, no lawn to mow or cars to park, Eloisa revels in the ordinary pleasures of life&#x2014;discovering corner museums that tourists overlook, chronicling Frenchwomen&#x2019;s sartorial triumphs, walking from one end of Paris to another.

It is doubly fascinating when the artist is someone as seductive and determined to capture attention as Tennessee Williams. This volume of his letters begins with a note, riddled with spelling errors, from the eight-year-old Williams at his grandfather's house to his mother and ends with a flurry of excited letters dating from the weeks following his first Broadway success, <i>The Glass Menagerie</i> . In between, we see Williams in several phases: distracted student; defensive college dropout; money-begging pathetic case; outraged, rejected writer; high-potential low achiever drifting through New Orleans, New Mexico, and New York. At times, especially during the period when he attended, in succession, the University of Missouri, Washington University, and the University of Iowa without ever quite finding his calling, it seems miraculous that he ever did pull it together. Each letter in this addictively readable collection is accompanied by some biographical text that places it in context in Williams' life and explains the obscurer and more personal allusions he makes. <i>Jack Helbig</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Among the storytellers was Earth Woman, aka Mrs. James Kipp and the daughter of Four Bears, Chief of the Mandans during the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Earth Woman repeated stories she had heard as a girl in her father&#39;s lodge told by Bird Woman - tales of traveling with two white chiefs to the &#34;Everywhere Salt Water.&#34; Here then is Sacagawea&#39;s own story, passed down to us in the tradition of Native American oral history through the writing of one of the early West&#39;s greatest storytellers and reprinted for the first time since 1918. Here you will meet Sacagawea, a woman of intelligence, courage and determination who proved to be crucial to the survival and success of the Corps of Discovery, the greatest expedition in the history of the United States.</p><p>As a child in the early 1800s, Earth Woman listened to nightly storytelling within the warm glow of the lodge of her father-- Four Bears, chief of the Mandans and friend of Chiefs Long Knife and Red Hair, also known as Captains Lewis and Clark. One of the storytellers was a young woman who, with her husband and infant child, had traveled with the two white chiefs to the land of the Everywhere Salt Water. She was called Bird Woman .. also Grass Woman, Lost Woman, Led-the-First-Big-Knives Woman, and ... Sacagawea. This is her story, as retold in the lodges of the Blackfeet by Earth Woman, aka Mrs. James Kipp, and Hugh Monroe, aka Rising Wolf, to fronteirsman and author James Willard Schultz. <p>Here then is Sacagwea's own story, passed down to us in the tradition of Native American oral history through the writing of one of the early West's greatest storytellers. Here you will meet Sacagawea, a woman of intelligence, courage and determination, who on occasion proved to be crucial to the survival and success of the Corps of Discovery, the greatest expedition in the history of the United States.</p>For many years following the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea was duly thought of as a heroine and even, by many, as the true guide of the Corps of Discovery. Much art and literature was composed to laud her spirit of adventure, her courage and her leadership role in the expedition. Familiar nineteenth century statues, for example, show her with right arm held up, finger pointed, guiding the explorers westward. Historical research has since demonstrated that, indeed, she did not lead the Corps or serve as key guide, but rather played a vital role in its survival and, in one instance the survival of its records.</p><h2>Concrete at Home: Innovative Forms and Finishes</h2><p>Fu-Tung Cheng&#39;s surprise bestseller Concrete Countertops paved the way for a fresh look at a familiar surface. His new book moves beyond the kitchen and transforms this commonplace material into an elegant medium that can be used throughout the house. Combining cutting-edge design with helpful how-to information, Concrete at Home offers ingenious ideas for planning and building walls, fireplaces, mantels, hearths, and exterior and interior floors, as well as tips on incorporating architectural elements such as counters, sinks, columns, and water pieces into the project. The construction of forms, footings, and ties is detailed in clear, easy-to-follow instructions, and special attention is given to finishing techniques, including adding color, texture, and inlays.</p><p>Eric Olsen is a journalist. He has published hundreds of magazine articles, a few short stories, and six nonfiction books. Olsen directed the International Institute of Modern Letters, a literary think-tank that helped writers who were victims of censorship, and created the first American City of Asylum, in Las Vegas. He was also the executive editor at Time Inc. Health, a Time Warner company. He is a graduate of the Iowa Writer&#39;s Workshop. He lives in Las Vegas.Cheng (<i>Concrete Countertops</i>) brings his skill and creativity to the rest of the house, exploring the design and building of floors, walls, patios and fireplaces as well as kitchen counters and sinks&#x2014;all using concrete. Not one to stick to basics, he offers suggestions for conceptualizing and integrating artful elements&#x2014;columns, fountains, inlays&#x2014;into nearly every room. Copious close-up photographs show Cheng and his team at work as they frame, pour, shape and finish concrete-centric projects for various clients. The books breaks down projects into manageable pieces, while detailed instructions and diagrams lead readers from idea through preparation to execution. Finishing touches and whimsical elements are important, and this detailed manual "contains a healthy respect for the discipline of the basics plus a twist of attitude from the artist." Readers possessing both skill and moxie will do best with this volume; since timing, measurements and other considerations are so important when working with concrete, the best approach would surely involve a thorough reading&#x2014;or two&#x2014;before deciding which one to undertake. And with a bit of thought and creativity, a wide variety of found objects (bits of coral, even a bowling trophy) can add personality to a piece. Cheng manages to infuse a DIY book on a nontraditional subject with personality, and his dry humor and offbeat approach to home design come through nicely. <i>(Apr.)</i></p><h2>Hunchback of Notre Dame (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>Outcast by society because of his hideous appearance, Quasimodo lives under the protection of Claude Frollo and the cathedral of Notre-Dame.

All rights reserved.</p>The story and characters in Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;have resonated with succeeding generations since its publication in 1831. It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Victor Hugo's flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the <br>day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Mis�rables, which Hugo would write thirty years later. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral. The inscription had been eradicated by the time the book was published, and Hugo feared that Notre-Dame's Gothic splendor might soon be lost to the contemporary fad for tearing down old buildings. Notre-Dame has survived as one of the great monuments of Paris, and Hugo's novel is a fitting celebration of it, a popular classic that is proving to be just as enduring. <br> <br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

It&#39;s not just being at the beck and call of the people upstairs, when even the children of the family can treat you like dirt, but having to deal with temperamental cooks, starchy butlers and chauffeurs with a roving eye. Marriage is the only escape, but with one evening off a week Margaret has no time to lose. Between Perce the bus conductor (who brings his mother on dates) and Mr Hailsham the fishmonger (who looks and smells a bit like his wares), her initial prospects are hardly the stuff of dreams. But then she meets Albert; a butcher boy-turned-milkman. Could he be the perfect husband? And can she make the perfect wife when, as she soon discovers, years spent serving others don&#39;t prepare you for managing your own life? Soon Margaret begins to wonder how can someone like her ever improve their station? Told with her trademark wit and warmth, Climbing the Stair</p><p>Margaret Powell was born in 1907 in Hove, and left school at the age of 13 to start working. At 14, she got a job in a hotel laundry room, and a year later went into service as a kitchen maid, eventually progressing to the position of cook, before marrying a milkman called Albert. In 1968 the first volume of her memoirs, Below Stairs, was published to instant success and turned her into a celebrity. She followed this up with Climbing the Stairs, The Treasure Upstairs and The Margaret Powell Cookery Book.

The last thing she has time for now is to take on a personal investigation for a poor <i>manouche</i> (Gypsy) boy.

She lives in San Francisco with her husband and visits Paris frequently.<b>Paris, April 1999 � Sunday, Late Afternoon</b><br><br>Aim�e Leduc clipped the French military GPS tracker to the wheel well, straightened up and gasped, seeing the Peugeot&#x2019;s owner standing in the shadowy Marais courtyard. So much for being <i>tr�s discr�te</i>. She&#x2019;d blown the surveillance&#x2014;now what? What was wrong with her, making a mistake like this? Why couldn&#x2019;t she shake off her postpartum baby brain?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Un peu trop �l�gante</i> for a mechanic. Maybe you&#x2019;re a <i>saboteuse</i>?&#x201d; said the Vicomte d&#x2019;Argenson, her target.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think. She wasn&#x2019;t even officially back from maternity leave until tomorrow, but she&#x2019;d taken the job because it had seemed like a piece of <i>g�teau</i>. &#x201c;A relative is trying to ruin me,&#x201d; the <i>comte</i> had told her when he&#x2019;d hired her. &#x201c;Find out who.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, staring across the seventeenth-century courtyard at the <i>comte</i>&#x2019;s nephew, she arranged her face in a pout. &#x201c;Just a little tracking device, Vicomte d&#x2019;Argenson. You&#x2019;re a hard man to catch up with and I want your story.&#x201d; She pulled her alias&#x2019;s card from her clutch bag. &#x201c;We journalists have to live, you know.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Paris Match?&#x201d;</i> he said, fingering her card.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little shrug sent a ripple of clicking across the metallic beading on her Courr�ges-clad shoulders. She hoped this ploy appealed to the portly rou�&#x2019;s vanity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>D&#x2019;accord</i>, put me on the cover and I&#x2019;ll give you a story. My story.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Deal.&#x201d; The dank late afternoon air in the courtyard chilled her, and the scent of damp stone clung to the hunting museum&#x2019;s walls. Vivaldi violin melodies wafted from the museum&#x2019;s reception, and the trailing ivy glistened in the light from the sconces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But I need the homing device you put under my car, <i>ma</i> <i>belle</i>.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e made a moue of resignation with her Chanel red lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m counting on the exclusive, Vicomte d&#x2019;Argenson.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time she&#x2019;d recovered the device and put it in his waiting palm, he&#x2019;d checked the other tires.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn paparazzi,&#x201d; he said, grinding the tracker under his heel on the cobbles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good thing she&#x2019;d put a second one inside his briefcase on the backseat. She activated the second tracker, smothering the click with a cough.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My number&#x2019;s at the bottom. <i>A bient�t</i>,&#x201d; she said, shooting him a complicit smile, and air-kissed somewhere in the vicinity of his cheek.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that she hurried through the tall doors, slipping the control, which was no bigger than a lighter, into the waiting hand of Maxence, Leduc Detective&#x2019;s intern hacker, who was posing as a valet.<br>She joined the <i>comte</i>&#x2019;s fiftieth birthday party. Mission almost complete, she thought. She stood under the chandelier in the thronged gala, a position from which she could keep one kohl-rimmed eye on <i>le vicomte</i>. Part of her enjoyed getting back to the grown-up world and off diaper duty for a few hours. The other was tinged with guilt for going back to work full-time tomorrow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notes from the violin drifted up to the hunting museum&#x2019;s twenty-foot ceiling. To avoid conversation, she pretended to admire the decor, suppressing shudders at the antler trophies; other walls were hung with medieval tapestries of gruesome hunting scenes. Meanwhile, her target stood amongst his entourage with a glass, looking bored. No suspicious contact yet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Interesting scent you&#x2019;re wearing.&#x201d; A member of <i>le vicomte</i>&#x2019;s entourage had appeared at her elbow. He had periwinkle-blue eyes and tousled curly hair. He offered her <i>une coupe de champagne</i>. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it called?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sniffed. Pureed aubergine. With her fingernail she scraped off the splattered souvenir her six-month-old daughter, Chlo�, had left on her clutch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A mixture of Chanel No. 5 and my own blend.&#x201d; She smiled flirtatiously and passed on the champagne. Not that she wasn&#x2019;t tempted. But this was work. And she was nursing.<br>At last, <i>le vicomte</i> separated himself from the crowd and made toward the door.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.&#x201d; </i>In three strides she&#x2019;d reached the doorway, speaking into the mic buried in her beaded collar. &#x201c;Target on the move.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxence nodded from the foyer in his valet garb. She adjusted her earwig&#x2019;s volume. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s asked for his car,&#x201d; said Maxence. &#x201c;Signal&#x2019;s coming through clear. Even with your clicking beads.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As planned. <i>Parfait</i>. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll take over from here, Maxence?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;On it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plenty of time to make it home, dress Chlo� and get to the church for the christening.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she passed Maxence, she took some francs from her clutch and handed them to him&#x2014;a tip to keep his cover. She winked at her employer, the <i>comte</i>, and headed into the candle-lit museum foyer, where she was taken aback by a giant taxidermied polar bear, one of the <i>comte</i>&#x2019;s donations to the wildlife collection. Men and their trophies! She presented her scooter&#x2019;s keys to the real <i>voiturier</i>. In exchange he handed her an envelope containing the <i>comte</i>&#x2019;s embossed card and a check.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She slid up the kickstand with her Louboutin heel and revved her loaner Vespa&#x2014;a bright turquoise model with more oomph than her own pink one, which was in the shop&#x2014;while she navigated the cobbled courtyard. Too bad the damned A-line Courr�ges rode up her thighs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could get used to this scooter&#x2019;s power. She gunned it down rue Beaubourg, weaving between a bus and a taxi in the street, wove around the H�tel de Ville, then turned left along the quai, past the budding green branches of the plane trees. But a roadblock stopped traffic before she could cross Pont Marie to the �le Saint-Louis. What now? A strike, an accident, police checking for drunk drivers? Her scooter stalled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tension knotted her shoulders. She couldn&#x2019;t make Chlo� late for her own christening. She dreaded the look on the priest&#x2019;s face after he&#x2019;d done a favor fitting them in; she&#x2019;d never live it down. As the traffic cleared, she kick-started the Vespa. Finally she pulled into her courtyard on �le Saint-Louis, jumped off the scooter, and ran up her apartment building&#x2019;s worn marble staircase.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e could handle it. <i>Vraiment</i>, she could: telecommuting part-time from her home office, she could still manage computer security virus scans and lucrative industrial surveillance. If only she could buy eight hours of sleep over the counter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got an appetite, your Chlo�,&#x201d; said Madame Cachou as she handed Aim�e a teaspoon. The sixty-something concierge had a stylish new blunt-cut grey bob. &#x201c;I changed her diaper two minutes ago, then laid out the gown.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ma puce,&#x201d;</i> Aim�e said, leaning down to kiss those cheeks, and thinking again how painfully like Melac&#x2019;s eyes Chlo�&#x2019;s grey-blue ones were. Those eyes reminded Aim�e of her baby&#x2019;s father every day. As for his total lack of interest in paternity&#x2014;Aim�e hadn&#x2019;t seen that coming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wasn&#x2019;t the only thing she didn&#x2019;t see coming. Chlo� coughed and pureed carrot hit Aim�e in the eye. Just one more of the daily surprises of motherhood, like the overwhelming protectiveness she felt toward her baby. Or how sleep deprived she could be. Aim�e wiped off the carrot and hoped to God they wouldn&#x2019;t be too late.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time she&#x2019;d cleaned her daughter&#x2019;s smiling, roseshaped mouth and her perfect chubby fists, Miles Davis, her bichon frise, had licked up every trace of orange from the kitchen tiles under the high chair. He&#x2019;d gained weight from all the cleaning up since Chlo� was born.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her life had changed. Instead of working long hours at the office before heading out for nights on the town, now she spent her afternoons taking Chlo� to the park in the stroller. There she joined the other children&#x2019;s mothers, who were laughing, commiserating and sharing apple juice and tips. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine not being a <i>maman, simplement</i>. She found herself trying to remember her own mother more and more often, the mother who&#x2019;d disappeared so long ago, now nothing but a footprint on the wave-washed shore of Aim�e&#x2019;s childhood. She missed her more than ever now that she was a mother herself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Chlo� would wear the gown Aim�e&#x2019;s mother had baptized Aim�e in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her phone trilled somewhere on the counter behind the baby bottles. By the time she found it, Chlo� had spit up all over her shoulder. Thankfully the burp cloth had caught it all. She hoped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re waiting at the church, Aim�e.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Five minutes, Ren�.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know the priest did us a special favor,&#x201d; said Ren�, his voice rising. &#x201c;Wedging us in this late on Sunday with the Easter rush.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Five minutes,&#x201d; she said again, clicking off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e deftly laid Chlo� on the changing table and pulled off the soiled onesie. She nuzzled her pink tummy with kisses, and Chlo� cooed with delight. Chlo�&#x2019;s sweet baby smell engulfed her as she slipped her into the lace christening gown.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She scooped up her secondhand Birkin bag, loaded it with some diapers and wipes, slipped into her cheetah-print heels and headed down the wide, worn marble stairs with Chlo� on her hip.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early evening, the quai-side lamps&#x2019; yellow-gold glow filtered through the plane trees. Below her flowed the khakicolored Seine. With any luck, Chlo� wouldn&#x2019;t need a diaper change before the priest started.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the corner, Martine, her best friend since the <i>lyc�e</i>, was pacing on the church steps. Martine wore a chic navy blue suit with matching straw hat, both Italian. She pulled Aim�e&#x2019;s arm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Mon Dieu,</i> Aim�e, everyone&#x2019;s waiting,&#x201d; said Martine. &#x201c;Love your dress.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My surveillance uniform.&#x201d; She hoped she hadn&#x2019;t missed any of Chlo�&#x2019;s spit up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Only you would call a vintage Courr�ges a uniform.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Got an upscale gig,&#x201d; she said under her breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need to borrow your Versace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They entered the church and found flickering votive candles, incense and a waiting crowd near the baptismal font in a side chapel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be late to your own funeral, Leduc.&#x201d; Morbier, Aim�e&#x2019;s godfather, bent down to kiss Chlo�.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bonsoir to you, too, mon parrain,&#x201d;</i> she said, using the term for godfather. A term she hadn&#x2019;t used since she wore knee socks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morbier, a <i>commissaire</i> and an old colleague of Aim�e&#x2019;s late father, looked rested for once, despite the drooping bags under his basset-hound eyes. He was wearing a three-piece suit&#x2014;a first. He stood arm in arm with a beaming Jeanne, his companion, all in yellow flounces. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I held you like that once,&#x201d; said Morbier. He reached out and touched her hair. Her throat caught.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was surprised to see her father&#x2019;s old police comrades since he&#x2019;d left the force under a cloud of allegations&#x2014;allegations that had taken her years to disprove. Lef�vre, an old Friday-night card-playing crony of her father&#x2019;s from the <i>commissariat</i>, along with Thomas Dussollier, another card player who&#x2019;d attended the police academy with her father and was about to retire. Both wore police uniforms. Lef�vre leaned on a cane; Thomas&#x2019;s dark hair was speckled grey. Dussollier held a photo out to her: her own christening, here at this same font, Dussollier, Morbier and her papa all young men. &#x201c;Jean-Claude would be so proud, Aim�e.&#x201d; His eyes brimmed. Hers, too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ren� Friant, godfather-to-be and her partner at Leduc Detective, looked relieved to see her. He wore a dark blue suit, matching cravat and cuff links. A dwarf at four feet tall, he stood on a stool by the baptismal font.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>La voil�</i>. Good of you to join us finally, Aim�e,&#x201d; said her old catechism teacher, P�re Michel, beckoning them closer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chlo� Jeanne Ren�e&#x2014;named for her great-grandmother, her grandfather Jean-Claude and her godfather-to-be, Ren�&#x2014;yawned. Aim�e&#x2019;s cousin Sebastian and his wife, Regula, beamed. Regula, six months along herself, was showing her bump.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incense tickled Aim�e&#x2019;s nose, and the splash of holy water brought back memories. Memories of coming here with her parents, and later, after her American mother had abandoned them, Morbier taking her small hand in his and bringing her to catechism classes. As she stood under the soaring seventeenth-century domed roof, it all passed before her like old photos in a slideshow. She grabbed at tradition in whatever family memories she could find.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the priest was about to begin, Martine tugged on Aim�e&#x2019;s sleeve and pointed to a man in a black jacket striding down the aisle. His magnetic grey-blue eyes caught Aim�e&#x2019;s. Still a hunk. A chord vibrated in her stomach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melac, her baby&#x2019;s father.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six long months without a word, and he could still make her heart pound. He&#x2019;d never even seen his daughter. Nor had he replied to the christening invitation, or called once. She noted his leanness, a deeper line added to the crinkle on his brow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She felt conflicted: both furious with him and glad that he had come. Maybe this was an olive branch that might lead to some involvement in her baby&#x2019;s life? But why hadn&#x2019;t he called, even once? Aim�e pulled Chlo� close, nuzzled her rose-pink cheek. &#x201c;<i>Ma puce,</i> he&#x2019;s your father, so let&#x2019;s be nice.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P�re Michel gave the blessing in his white cassock.

Glowingly surreal illustrations decorate the slight story and enhance the comedy of the fairly simple plot. Otis the penguin, along with his friends Ronald-Ann, Bill the Cat, and Milquetoast the Housebug, sets out in search of a prehistoric beast known as the Last Basselope. Once found, the beast turns out to be friendly rather than ferocious, and the intrepid adventurers decide to protect rather than exploit it. Breathed's sense of humor is delightfully sarcastic and sophisticated, but it may be missed by some younger readers. They may, however, find the sheer silliness of the tale appealing and enjoy the chance to see in book form some of the familiar characters from Bloom County and Outland. Older children and adults are more likely to appreciate the satiric view of television, print media, and contemporary society's materialistic values. Clearly, though, the usefulness of this title will depend upon the popularity of the author and the likelihood of patron interest and demand, for it is an extension of Breathed's work rather than a truly independent effort. --Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>neckbone: visual verses</h2><p>The &#x201c;blk alter&#x201d; of Avery R.

This bilingual facsimile of the first edition contains a new text by founder of the Masahisa Fukase Archives, Tomo Kosuga. His essay locates Ravens in Fukase&#x2019;s wider work and life, and is illustrated with numerous recently discovered photographs and drawings. Fukase&#x2019;s haunting series of work was made between 1975 and 1986 in the aftermath of a divorce and was apparently triggered by a mournful train journey to his hometown. The coastal landscapes of Hokkaido serve as the backdrop for his profoundly dark and impressionistic photographs of ominous flocks of crows.

This book is signed by Lindsey Stirling &amp; Brooke S. Passey. The photos shown are of a representative book. Each book, of course, has unique signatures. *** Dancing electronic violinist Lindsey Stirling shares her unconventional journey in an inspiring memoir filled with the energy, persistence, and humor that have helped her successfully pursue a passion outside the box. A classically trained musician gone rogue, Lindsey Stirling is the epitome of independent, millennial-defined success: after being voted off the set of America's Got Talent, she went on to amass more than ten million social media fans, record two full-length albums, release multiple hits with billions of YouTube views, and to tour sold-out venues across the world. Lindsey is not afraid to be herself. In fact, it's her confidence and individuality that have propelled her into the spotlight. But the road hasn't been easy. After being rejected by talent scouts, music reps, and eventually on national television, Lindsey forged her own path, step by step. Detailing every trial and triumph she has faced until now, Lindsey shares stories of her humble yet charmed childhood, humorous adolescence, life as a struggling musician, personal struggles with anorexia, and finally, success as a world-class entertainer. Lindsey's magnetizing story- at once remarkable and universal- is a testimony that there is no singular recipe for success, and despite what people may say, sometimes it's okay to be The Only Pirate at the Party. Lindsey Stirling is an acclaimed electronic violinist, who has over 7 million YouTube subscribers, and 11 billion views on her YouTube channel. She has enjoyed Billboard chart-topping hits and sold out tours worldwide, all without the backing of a label.</p><p></p><h2>Judge Dredd: Complete Case Files, Vol. 7</h2><p>The Complete Case Files series is a chronological collection of all of Judge Dredd's adventures.<br><br>Another bumper crop of cases for Dredd in this action-packed volume, collecting together some of the very best in 2000 AD thrills!

Through it all, Motown provided the beat. This book tells the story of Motown--as both musical style and entrepreneurial phenomenon--and of its intrinsic relationship to the politics and culture of Motor Town, USA.</p><p>As Suzanne Smith traces the evolution of Motown from a small record company firmly rooted in Detroit's black community to an international music industry giant, she gives us a clear look at cultural politics at the grassroots level. Here we see Motown's music not as the mere soundtrack for its historical moment but as an active agent in the politics of the time. In this story, Motown Records had a distinct role to play in the city's black community as that community articulated and promoted its own social, cultural, and political agendas. Smith shows how these local agendas, which reflected the unique concerns of African Americans living in the urban North, both responded to and reconfigured the national civil rights campaign.</p><p>Against a background of events on the national scene--featuring Martin Luther King, Jr., Langston Hughes, Nat King Cole, and Malcolm X--<i>Dancing in the Street</i> presents a vivid picture of the civil rights movement in Detroit, with Motown at its heart. This is a lively and vital history. It's peopled with a host of major and minor figures in black politics, culture, and the arts, and full of the passions of a momentous era. It offers a critical new perspective on the role of popular culture in the process of political change.</p></p><p>Suzanne E. Smith is Professor of History at George Mason University.The publication of <i>Dancing in the Streets,</i> is an interesting one for an academic press; there's no shortage of general-audience books on the famed soul label, and other books have plumbed the immediate political ramifications of Berry Gordy's family-loan-turned-empire. But Smith aims not to glorify Motown as a can-do parable of black business, but to define it wholly--as a flawed microcosm of Detroit as much as one of black America. At once symptom and synecdoche, Motown is in her eyes the inevitable sum of its influences that somehow reenacted Detroit's external struggles on its own Grand Street stage. (Peter Rubin <i>Boston Book Review</i>)<br><br>In her scholarly, informative, <i>Dancing in the Street</i>, Suzanne E. Smith reconsiders Motown, not just as the background music of the city's struggles but as a component of black Detroit's march for civil rights and social justice. (Ren�e Graham <i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br><i>Dancing in the Street</i> is a wonderful blend of thorough research, firsthand interviews and an impassioned discussion of the music which keeps the book far away from the suffocating reaches of the academy. Smith, a Detroit native, has found in Motown's apparent order (its arrangements, performers and beats) the perfect juxtaposition to Detroit's growing disorder (in the riots, police violence and cultural devastation of urban renewal). (<i>Detroit Metro Times</i>)<br><br>Though we would all count Stevie Wonder, Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye among Motown's greatest recording artists, Suzanne E. Smith would add another: Martin Luther King Jr...[Smith] is correct when she says it has become all but impossible to separate what happened in Detroit in the 1960s from the music that was playing when it did: as Norman Whitfield, the producer who replaced Holland-Dozier-Holland as the label's primary hitmaker, put it in a song he wrote for the Temptations, it was a 'Ball of Confusion.' Thirty years later, we're still unraveling it, and <i>Dancing in the Street</i> affords valuable insights to those of us who were there and those of us who weren't...It is fascinating reading for anyone who believes the sound of young America was not incompatible with the sound of struggle. (Terry Lawson <i>Detroit Free Press</i>)<br><br>[<i>Dancing in the Street</i> discovers] a new approach to what had seemed an exhausted subject. [Suzanne Smith's] self-imposed task is to draw back from the larger picture of Motown's conquest of the international market, setting the company in its immediate context in Detroit, the community from which it emerged and after which it was named, and examining its relationship with the civil-rights struggle...[This book] adds a new dimension to our understanding of the forces that created music which has already outlasted the long hot summers for which it was designed. (Richard Williams <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>In telling the story of the [Motown] label in its habitat, and telling it as an everyday tale of race in America, Suzanne Smith performs an act of historical rescue. (Andrew Blake <i>The Independent</i>)<br><br>Now, thanks to the publication of the fascinating <i>Dancing in the Street</i> music fans as well as lovers of social history can grasp for the first time the unique nature of Detroit's daily social scheme and its impact on the lives of those who embodied the Motown Sound during the parallel cresting of the civil rights movement...Smith takes readers into the heretofore unexamined sphere of Detroit's sidewalk-level social ferment from Motown's founding in 1958 on through the city's devastating riots in 1967 and the related early-'70s flight from its precincts of the two enterprises central to its modern identity...If you've never heard about the Concept East Theater; or of WCHB, the first radio station built, owned, and operated by African-Americans; or never knew about organizations like the League of Revolutionary Black Workers; or the Freedom Now Part (the first all-black political party in the nation), Smith's text will explain their rich legacies. (Timothy White <i>Billboard</i>)<br><br>Smith performs a valuable service in showing that Gordy, rather than being the rugged individualist often depicted, was the product of a hard-working and supportive family, one that had displayed a relentless self-help ethic for generations...To be sure, Smith is mainly concerned with the larger issues, but she does a good job of giving behind-the-scenes glimpses of the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and other Motown myths. While capitalism worked very well for Motown and its principles, Smith concludes, it was a far less effective system in exposing and eradicating the roots of racism. (Edward Morris <i>Foreword Magazine</i>)<br><br>Suzanne E. Smith investigates the connections between music and a positive force: civil rights. Smith's compelling work depicts the exponential growth of the Motown recording company and reveals its role in shaping the civil rights movement in the urban North. (<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>)<br><br>A finely rendered history of the storybook success of the 'Motown Sound,' arguably the most resonant cultural development of its time, within the localized context of urban turmoil and the civil-rights struggle...Relying on primary sources and on the recollections of Motown's acts, employees, and session players, Smith touchingly captures the industrious determination of a cultural community whose ambitions were underwritten by social cohesion and a generations-strong work ethic...She captures the spirit of this exciting time by focusing on individuals (Nat King Cole, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Motown discoveries like the Supremes and Marvin Gaye) whose actions were central to their era's cultural and civil-rights triumphs. More sobering is her re-creation of events leading to Detroit's 1967 riots, when intransigents on both sides of the color line overrode more moderate, conciliatory factions, leading the city toward a conflagration that permanently sundered the region's black and white communities. This reconstruction of Motown's meteoric popular rise during an era of fractious social division is compelling and informative for both aficionados of the music and students of American urban history.

But unlike the painter, the chocolate maker has made it possible for even the amateur to achieve his artistry. In <i>Chocolate Obsession</i> Recchiuti, owner of the famed artisanal chocolate company in San Francisco, divulges his professional secrets and techniques, allowing home cooks to reproduce his exquisite confections in their own kitchens. <br><br>Opening with a complete discussion of chocolate from bean to bar, the book goes on to offer detailed instructions for dipped chocolates, truffles, and molded chocolates, including Recchiuti's signature ganache flavors: Earl Grey tea, burnt caramel, tarragon with grapefruit. Also featured are recipes for such sinfully delicious treats as Chocolate Shortbread Cookies with Truffle Cream Filling, Double Dark Chocolate Souffl�s, and Rocky Recchiuti Brownies. With more than 60 recipes in all, this book will satisfy even the most obsessive chocolate lovers among us.</p><p>Michael Recchiuti started his chocolate business in San Francisco in 1997 after a successful career at some of the top restaurants in Philadelphia. His chocolates were soon recognized for their sophistication and originality, and they have been featured in the <i>New York Times, Food &amp; Wine</i>, and many other publications. He lives in San Francisco.It's Chemistry 101 all over again. But never have science textbooks featured close-to-three-dimensional photographs (courtesy of pro Maren Caruso), such an elegant array of recipes (more than 60), and ideas and flavors that will bowl over every reader. Yet consider that the main author is Michael Recchiuti, a San Franciscan called the Picasso of chocolatiers, and that his cohort, Fran Gage, once owned a locally esteemed patisserie and now writes for national gourmet-type publications. That combination of expertise creates a beyond-the-novice collection of both recipes and information that chocoholic bakers will be hard-pressed to do without. Unusual flavors (for instance, key lime pears and lavender vanilla ganache) and two-page features (Michael shopping for produce at a Bay-area farm, for instance) culminate with cooking directions to produce a book that's so much more than a coffee-table object.

Perhaps Broadway's high-profile revival of <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> sparked the creation of this attractive but strained visual interpretation of the musical's ballad "Sunrise, Sunset." Schoenherr's delicately brushed paintings go a long way toward rescuing lyrics pried infelicitously from their musical context; touching double-page spreads unfold the courtship and marriage of a young man and woman, occasionally interrupted by images of the couple as playful children. Unfortunately, it's hard not to notice the odd juxtaposition between the consistently joyful images and the song's bittersweet undertones ("One season following another, / Laden with happiness and tears"), and the shtetl setting comes without any discussion that might contextualize the imagery for readers unfamiliar with traditional Jewish culture. Still, music instructors eager for books with tie-ins to familiar songs may appreciate this effort, as will libraries serving large Jewish communities, whose Orthodox members will see many of their own traditions reflected here. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Johnson defined affirmative action as a legitimate federal goal, and 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon named one of affirmative action's chief antagonists the head of the Department of Labor, government officials at all levels addressed racial economic inequality in earnest. Providing members of historically disadvantaged groups an equal chance at obtaining limited and competitive positions, affirmative action had the potential to alienate large numbers of white Americans, even those who had viewed school desegregation and voting rights in a positive light. Thus, affirmative action was&#x2015;and continues to be&#x2015;controversial.<br><br>Novel in its approach and meticulously researched, David Hamilton Golland's <i>Constructing Affirmative Action: The Struggle for Equal Employment Opportunity</i> bridges a sizeable gap in the literature on the history of affirmative action. Golland examines federal efforts to diversify the construction trades from the 1950s through the 1970s, offering valuable insights into the origins of affirmative action&#x2013;related policy. <i>Constructing Affirmative Action</i> analyzes how community activism pushed the federal government to address issues of racial exclusion and marginalization in the construction industry with programs in key American cities.</p><p>David Hamilton Golland is assistant professor of history at Governors State University."David Golland's <i>Constructing Affirmative Action: The Struggle for Equal Employment Opportunity</i> is a wonderful work that examines the impact of local civil rights movements on national leadership and public policy. The book explores how local groups pushed for affirmative action forcing national leaders to react. But this interaction was not always to the benefit of local leaders or the people whom they represented. Golland provides elaborate details of the politics of the Philadelphia Plan and the impact this affirmative action had on the nation."&#x2015;Clarence Taylor, author of <i>Reds at the Blackboard: Communism, Civil Rights, and the New York City Teachers Union</i>"<p>"Golland provides an in-depth historical accounting of 'bureaucratic inertia,' 'urban crisis,' development of Philadelphia Plan, and the roles of mainstreem civil rights organizations, labor, contractors, and industry . . . The author documents presidential politics beginning with Franklin Delano Roosevelt and refutes Richard Nixon's sincerity."&#x2015;<i>Choice</i>"</p><p>"<i>Constructing Affirmative Action </i>offers a thoughtful new interpretation, clearly presented and based on judicious research in primary sources. It will become the standard book on the struggle for equal employment opportunity in the construction trades."&#x2015;<i>Journal of American History</i>"</p><p>"Few historians have focused so much research on the construction industry and trade unions as one of the key sites of the modern affirmative action battle. With the U.S. Supreme Court possibly poised to overturn affirmative action, we need to see what we may lose with its dismantling."&#x2015;<i>American Historical Review</i>"&#x2015;</p></p><h2>Sight-Readings: American Fictions</h2><p>It is only in a country where newness and change and brevity of tenure are the common substance of life," wrote Henry James, "that the fact of one's ancestors having lived for a hundred and seventy years in a single spot would become an element of one's morality." Newness and rootedness are the twin poles of Sight-Readings, Elizabeth Hardwick's brilliant new collection of essays. (Her first, Seduction and Betrayal, was nominated for the National Book Award.) Hardwick's focus here is on American writers, at home and abroad, and especially women, as writers and as characters: Edith Wharton, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein, Mary McCarthy, Elizabeth Bishop, Katherine Anne Porter, and Joan Didion, among others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sections on Old New York, Americans Abroad, and Fictions of America, Hardwick considers writers and their landscapes, real and imagined. Her essays on Edith Wharton and Henry James illuminate aspects of their inventions of New York. From there she takes us to the Paris of Gertrude Stein and Djuna Barnes, into the hermetic world of Boston Transcendentalism, and on to the suburbs of John Cheever, the America of Philip Roth and John Updike, and the restless expanses of Richard Ford and the Prairie poets. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Hardwick has achieved a permanent place in American letters for her sharp and elegant criticism. Her essays on American writers are them-selves a work of literature.</p><p>Although Elizabeth Hardwick is the author of two highly praised novels--one of them, <i>Sleepless Nights</i>, a nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award--she is primarily known as a critic. Yet that word, with its contemporary whiff of consumer advocacy, doesn't quite fit the bill either. Hardwick never practices the literary equivalent of quality control, never bestows her stamp of approval on the likes of Henry James or Elizabeth Bishop. Instead she creates brilliant, unpredictable <i>narratives</i>, in which books and their authors are the main characters.<p> In <i>Sight-Readings</i>, her fourth collection of essays, Hardwick trains her superbly idiosyncratic eye on a procession of American writers. Rolling out the red carpet for Henry James, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein, Margaret Fuller, or Richard Ford, she dares us <i>not</i> to read her pick hits. Of course, this wittiest of critics is willing to administer the occasional cudgel, decrying the nonstop fornication in John Updike's novels or the "infernal indiscretion" of Vachel Lindsay's poetry. But even her most acerbic pronouncements, like this one about incessant word-tinkerer Gertrude Stein, tell us something valuable: "When she is not tinkering, we can see her like a peasant assaulting the chicken for Sunday dinner. She would wring the neck of her words." And Hardwick's digressions are invariably gifts, essayistic windfalls. Discussing Edith Wharton's rather tony vision of Manhattan, for example, she writes: "New York, with its statistical sensationalism, is a shallow vessel for memory since it lives in a continuous present, making it difficult to recall the shape of the loss deplored, whether it be the gray tin of the newsstand or the narrow closet for the neighborhood's dry cleaning, there and gone over a vacation." As a summation of the city's self-perpetuating amnesia, you couldn't do better than that. It should be emblazoned, in <i>tiny</i> letters, on the back of each and every subway token. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>Praise for Elizabeth Hardwick:<br><br>"While the grace of Hardwick's prose makes her endlessly readable, the deep focus of her insights, the grasp of her subtle intelligence, again and again make one stop after reading a passage to examine it further, or even a third time, and so to get all the riches it may have to offer."--The Boston Globe<br><br>"Hardwick's gift is to give flesh to abstraction, to make us feel a whole range of sensations through her willingness to let her imagination soar."--The Philadelphia Inquirer</p><h2>The Total Dirt Rider Manual (Dirt Rider): 358 Essential Dirt Bike Skills</h2><p>Many motorcyclists got their start on a dirt bike, and many more have learned the joy and freedom of trail riding and adventure touring.

Enjoy the pride of ownership, turn a blind eye to the instant depreciation of a vehicle that comes with knobby tires, and be aware of what that brand new bike needs.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>PREP </b>Most bikes need more grease on the steering stem, linkage, and swingarm bearings. While you&#x2019;re at it, work a dab of anti-seize grease into the rear axle adjustment bolt threads.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>MAINTENANCE </b>Air filter oil migrates down. Check that the top of the filter is tacky with oil and re-oil it with air filter oil if it is dry on the top. Stock chains stretch quickly, so put on a top-of-the-line chain right away to save money on sprockets in the long run.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>BREAK-IN </b>A good common-sense break-in is to give the engine a heat cycle. Get it up to operating temperature on the stand, then let it cool. Don&#x2019;t lug the engine in a gear too high for the first rides or scream it in a gear too low. Suspension breaks in, too. Watch the shock sag and keep it adjusted where you want it.</p><h2>Living with the Devil: A Meditation on Good and Evil</h2><p>A personal meditation by the best-selling Buddhist philosopher considers the existence of evil in the world, drawing on western and Buddhist literature to profile the devil as a deceptive or distracting obstacle to true goodness and humility. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Stephen Batchelor is a former monk in the Tibetan and Zen traditions. He has translated and written several books on Buddhism, including Shantideva's <i>A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life</i>, <i>Alone with Others</i>, <i>The Faith to Doubt</i>, <i>The Tibet Guide</i> (winner of the 1988 Thomas Cook Award), and <i>The Awakening of the West</i> (joint winner of the 1994 Tricycle Award).The author of <i>Buddhism Without Beliefs</i> and a former monk in the Tibetan and Zen traditions, Batchelor works to reconcile the fears, desires, and compulsions of the ego (the devil or <i>Mara</i>) with the certainty of death. Drawing on a rich variety of literature, religious tradition and history, Batchelor demonstrates how the anguish associated with the transient nature of life has preoccupied humans for centuries: Job wrestles with his fate; Pascal's writings reflect his dread at being expelled from the universe when his existence would eventually come to a close. Surveying responses to this intractable problem, Batchelor concludes that mankind has always relied on the temptations of the devil to still anxiety and create an aura of permanence. Compulsive activities, lustful behavior and behaving violently and destructively to others are all evils that stem from <i>Mara</i>. Overcoming these feelings and pursuing the way of love and compassion, for Batchelor, rests on one's ability to make peace with the devil and nourish one's "Buddha nature." Although he explores a number of philosophies, Batchelor's focus is on the path to nirvana (a cessation of desires) forged by Siddhartha Gautama, an Indian prince and the historical Buddha, whose life and thinking are presented in some detail. Some of the references will be obscure to neophytes, but Batchelor's genuine concern and desire for a better world come through clearly. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hidden islands! Earthquakes! Giant airships! Sea monsters! Jack Black, son of the captain of the <i>Bellerophon</i>, the largest airship in the world, knows he's headed for adventure when he joins his father on an around-the-world trip. But he has no idea of the extent of his upcoming escapades.

But history was not their most important focus. Rather, the Ahnenerbe was an essential part of Himmler's master plan for the Final Solution. The findings of the institute were used to convince armies of SS men that they were entitled to slaughter Jews and other groups. And Himmler also hoped to use the research as a blueprint for the breeding of a new Europe in a racially purer mold.<br><br><em>The Master Plan</em> is a groundbreaking expos� of the work of German scientists and scholars who allowed their research to be warped to justify extermination, and who directly participated in the slaughter--many of whom resumed their academic positions at war's end. It is based on Heather Pringle's extensive original research, including previously ignored archival material and unpublished photographs, and interviews with living members of the institute and their survivors.<br><br>A sweeping history told with the drama of fiction, <em>The Master Plan</em> is at once horrifying, transfixing, and monumentally important to our comprehension of how something as unimaginable as the Holocaust could have progressed from fantasy to reality.</p><p><strong>Heather Pringle</strong> is the author of <em>The Mummy Congress</em>. Her work as a journalist has appeared in <em>Science</em>, <em>Geo</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and <em>Discover</em>, where she is currently a contributing editor. She has lectured across the United States and Canada--from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., to the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. She lives in British Columbia.Considering the thousands of volumes covering every aspect of the Nazis, it's becoming increasingly difficult to say anything new about their dreadful era. Nevertheless, Pringle (<i>The Mummy Congress</i>), a contributing editor to <i>Discover </i>magazine, gamely steps up to the plate&#x2014;and has produced a fascinating volume detailing the Nazis' crackpot theories about prehistory and the Indiana Jones&#x2013;style lengths they went to prove them. Employing a team of researchers, Pringle investigates Heinrich Himmler's private think tank, the Ahnenerbe, which dispatched scholars to the most inhospitable and distant parts of the world to discover evidence of ancient Aryan conquests and the Germans' racial superiority. Some believed their own bizarre garbage; others perverted the facts for personal advancement or prostituted their reputations for the greater glory of Hitler. While it would be otherwise easy to laugh off the Ahnenerbe's ludicrous theories, Pringle argues that the institute provided the "academic" justification for the Holocaust and assembles a powerful body of evidence to that effect. Though one may wonder just how central the Ahnenerbe actually was to Hitler's thinking, when Pringle meets one of the most sinister of Himmler's scholars, his pride about the institute's "research" is distinctly disquieting. This is first-rate popular history&#x2014;supported by an immense amount of scholarly apparatus in a range of languages. <i>(Feb. 15)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Acclaimed author Marc Barasch brilliantly explores the nature and practice of compassion: What can we learn from exceptionally empathic people? Can we increase our compassion quotient? How do we open our hearts to those who do us harm? What if the great driving force of our evolution were actually survival of the kindest? Drawing on science and spirituality, history and popular culture, bottom-line business and a high-sense of fun, here is a startling, provocative argument that a simple shift in consciousness &#34;can change pretty much everything.&#34; With a keen balance of hope and realism, Marc Barasch set out on a journey to the heart of compassion, discovering its power to change who we are and the society we might become. He describes his own encounters with primates who demonstrate the roots of human empathy, and with Buddhist monks whose brain scans show how the practice of kindness actually resculpts our neural pathways. He vividly profiles his moving encounters with a man who donated his kidney to a stranger, and a man who forgave his daughter&#39;s murderer; with teenage Palestinian and Israeli girls learning to wage peace; even with astronomers trying to devise a missive to E.T. that we humans are not only clever, but kind.</p><p><p><b>Praise for <i>The Compassionate Life</i></b></p> <p>"An argument for compassion that is balanced yet persuasive--and long overdue.

While watching them, I realized that their physical differences disappeared. What remained were the visual images of the harmonized colors and the movements of the umbrellas. It seemed to me that these children were claiming that they were all equal in spite of their physical differences. That is exactly what I wanted to tell in my book.The acoustic, compelling "plink, plink" played on the higher octaves of the piano appropriately sets the mood for paging through Yellow Umbrella, a wordless picture book packaged and designed to be read with an enclosed classical-style music CD. Originally published in South Korea, the volume is both delicate and handsome, with illustrator Jae Soo Liu presenting a high-rise view of colorful umbrellas carried by children on a rainy walk to school. The joyful hues multiply with each successive spread. Composer Dong II Sheen gracefully glides between rhythms throughout the 15 tracks here (a deep, persistent beat accompanies paintings that include a train; jaunty notes sprinkle other rain scenes), maintaining an overall happy tone. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tangerine</h2><p>Paul Fisher sees the world from behind glasses so thick he looks like a bug-eyed alien.

But he wasn't the patient. Stepien's wife, Ellen, was just beginning her battle with aggressive breast cancer. That day, while listening to the oncologist's treatment strategy, Stepien began writing <i>Dying to Be Happy: Discovering the Truth About Life</i>. <br><br> In the pages of this book, a brush with a life-threatening disease sparks a frank discussion on mortality. The author explores the prospects of embracing death on a daily basis versus denying it. He encourages readers to follow the advice of Jesus Christ: always be ready for the end of life. Along the way, Stepien highlights a spectrum of short, true stories where people rise above the fear of death, including the harrowing account of a child who survived the Holocaust&#x2014;Stepien's own mother. <br><br>But <i>Dying to Be Happy</i> is more than an anthology of grim tales and close calls. It beckons readers to admit the inescapability of death in order to find true joy in this life and the next.</p><p>Metro Detroit native Chris Stepien began his professional journalistic career as a television producer-director and writer for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). After working eight years at WXYZ-TV, Detroit, and winning six EMMY awards, Stepien left broadcasting and co-founded Adventure, Inc., a Detroit-based video/film production company. Currently, Stepien is the writer, creative director, and owner of Stepien Creative Services, Inc..</p><h2>Bleach (3-in-1 Edition), Vol. 18: Includes vols. 52, 53 &amp; 54 (18)</h2><p>Part-time high school student, full-time Soul Reaper, Ichigo is one of the chosen few sword-wielding guardians of the afterlife.<br><br>Ichigo Kurosaki never asked for the ability to see ghosts&#x2014;he was born with the gift.

These are a selection representing only about a third of Luther's works in the Latin and German of the standard Weimar Edition, not including the German Bible.<br><br>Luther's expositions of the Sermon on the Mount and the Magnificat are masterpieces. Here Luther speaks about faith, about good works, about prayer, about Christian love, about the giving of alms, about war, about bearing witness to the Truth, about virtues and vices of many kinds. Above all, he stresses the everlasting love of Christ. Luther, always fearless and forthright, becomes bitingly eloquent when he talks about greed--greed as it came, and still comes, to the fore among men, women, and children in every walk of life, among many preachers as well as among many politicians. He writes: ''This much is sure: as soon as a preacher or minister becomes greedy, he becomes useless, and his preaching becomes worthless. He has to be cautious; he does not dare to denounce anyone; he lets the donations come in till they stuff his mouth. ... Thus he neglects his duty to denounce the wicked.'' The Reformer also shows that Mary's canticle has an important message for everyone. His outstanding ability as a linguist and his deep understanding of the Word of God are evident on every page.</p><p>Martin Luther (1483, 1546) was a German monk, a theologian and church reformer, he is considered to be the founder of Protestantism. Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>Knife Children</h2><p>Lakewalker Barr Foxbrush returns from two years of patrolling the bitter wilds of Luthlia against the enigmatic, destructive entities called malices, only to find that the secret daughter he&#39;d left behind in the hinterland of Oleana has disappeared from her home after a terrible accusation. The search for her will call on more of Barr&#39;s mind and heart than just his mage powers, as he tries to balance his mistakes of the past and his most personal duties to the future.</p><p></p><h2>Butterfly House</h2><p>With the help of her grandfather, a little girl makes a house for a larva and watches it develop before setting it free, and every summer after that butterflies come to visit her.

If we give ourselves the chance to look at tragedy, we might see further and more clearly.</p><p><b>SIMON CRITCHLEY</b>&nbsp;is Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research. His many books include <i>Very Little .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Almost Nothing, The Book of Dead Philosophers, The Faith of the Faithless, </i>and <i>Memory Theater. </i>He is the series moderator of "The Stone," a philosophy column in<i> The New York Times, </i>to which he is a frequent contributor.Introduction<br>&nbsp;<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Feeding the Ancients with Our Own Blood</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tragedy shows what is perishable, what is fragile, and what is slow moving about us. In a world defined by relentless speed and the unending acceleration of information flows that cultivate amnesia and an endless thirst for the short-term future allegedly guaran�teed through worship of the new prosthetic gods of technology, tragedy is a way of applying the emergency brake.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tragedy slows things down by confronting us with what we do not know about ourselves: an unknown force that unleashes violent effects on us on a daily, indeed often minute-by-minute basis. Such is the sometimes terrifying presence of the past that we might seek to disavow but that will have its victory in the end, if only in the form of our mortality. We might think we are through with the past, but the past isn&#x2019;t through with us. Through its sud�den reversals of fortune and rageful recognition of the truth of our origins, tragedy permits us to come face-to-face with what we do <i>not </i>know about ourselves but what makes those selves the things they are. Tragedy provokes what snags in our being, the snares and booby traps of the past that we blindly trip over in our relentless, stumbling, forward movement. This is what the ancients called &#x201c;fate,&#x201d; and it requires our complicity in order to come down on us.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet, the fruit of a consideration of tragedy is not a sense of life&#x2019;s hopelessness or moral resignation, as Schopenhauer thought, but&#x2014;I think&#x2014;a deepened sense of the self in its utter depen�dency on others. It is a question of the self&#x2019;s vulnerable exposure to apparently familiar and familial patterns of kinship (although it sometimes turns out that, like Oedipus, you don&#x2019;t know who your parents are, but if you do know who your parents are, you still don&#x2019;t know <i>who </i>they are). One of the most salient but enig�matic features of Greek tragedy is its constant negotiation with the other, especially the enemy other, the foreign other, the &#x201c;barbaric&#x201d; other. The oldest extant piece of theater that we possess, Aeschy�lus&#x2019;s <i>The Persians, </i>from 472 BCE, depicts the defeated enemy not with triumph but with sympathy and with an anticipation of the possible humiliation that might face the Athenians should they repeat the <i>hybris </i>of the Persians by invading Greece and desecrat�ing the altars of the enemy&#x2019;s gods. Sadly, the Athenians did not heed Aeschylus&#x2019;s lesson, and the brief period of Athenian imperial hegemony in the central decades of the fifth century BCE ended in the humiliating defeat of the Peloponnesian Wars. There is per�haps a moral to be drawn here for our time and place, where the empire knows its heyday is over and we live in a constant state of war. The first rule of war is sympathy with the enemy. This is something that can be seen in the tragedies of Euripides, espe�cially those that deal with the bloody end of the Trojan War, in plays like <i>The Trojan Women </i>and <i>Hecuba.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>As Aristotle put it perspicuously and somewhat blithely nearly a century after the zenith of Greek drama in the second half of the fifth century BCE, tragedy is the imitation of action, <i>mimesis praxeos</i>. But what exactly is meant by action? It is far from clear. In play after play of the three great tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides), what we see are characters who are utterly disori�ented by the situation in which they find themselves. They do not know <i>how </i>to act. We find human beings somehow compelled to follow a path of suffering that allows them to raise questions that admit of no easy answer: What will happen to me? How can I choose the right path of action? The overwhelming experience of tragedy is a <i>disorientation </i>expressed in one bewildered and fre�quently repeated question: <i>What shall I do?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br>Tragedy is not about the metaphysical cultivation of the <i>bios theoretikos, </i>the contemplative life that is the supposed fruit of philosophy in Aristotle&#x2019;s <i>Ethics</i>, or in Epicurus and the other Hel�lenistic schools<i>. </i>Nor is it about the cultivation of the life of the gods or divine life, <i>ho bios theois, </i>which is also the constant prom�ise of philosophy from Plato onward, as we will see. No, tragedy is thinking <i>in </i>action, thinking <i>upon </i>action, <i>for the sake of </i>action, where the action takes place offstage and is often described to us indirectly through the character of a messenger. But this thinking takes the form of a radical questioning: How do I act? What shall I do? If tragedy is <i>mimesis praxeos, </i>then it is action that is called into question through tragedy, divided and sliced open. What the experience of tragedy invites is neither the blind impulsiveness of action, nor some retreat into a solitary life of contemplation, but the <i>difficulty </i>and <i>uncertainty </i>of action in a world defined by ambi�guity, where right always seems to be on both sides. Hegel is right to insist that tragedy is the collision between opposed yet mutu�ally justified claims to what is right. But if both sides are right, then what on earth do we do?<br>&nbsp;<br>Part of the joy of wandering into the ancient world and dealing with seemingly remote phenomena like Attic tragedy (and I will use the adjectives Attic, Athenian, and Greek interchangeably to name the same phenomenon) is how little we know and how little we will ever know. Of the many things we <i>don&#x2019;t </i>know about ancient tragedy, the most important and most enigmatic is some sense of what the spectator was expected to take away from these spectacles. The ancient Greek word for &#x201c;spectator&#x201d; was <i>theoros, </i>from which we get the word <i>theoria, </i>theory. <i>Theoria </i>is linked to the verb &#x201c;to see,&#x201d; <i>theorein, </i>which takes place in a theater, a <i>theatron, </i>to name the act of spectating. If tragedy is the imitation of action, of <i>praxis, </i>although the nature of action remains deeply enigmatic, then <i>praxis </i>is something seen from a theoretical perspective. Or, better said perhaps, the question of theory and practice, or the <i>gap </i>between theory and practice, first opens <i>in </i>theater and <i>as </i>theater. Theater is always theoretical, and theory is a theater, where we are spectators on a drama that unfolds: <i>our </i>drama. In theater, human action, human <i>praxis, </i>is called into question theoretically. Other�wise said, <i>praxis </i>is internally divided or questioned by <i>theoria </i>in the space of the theater, where the empty space of the theater is a way of calling into question the spaces we inhabit and subverting the divisions that constitute social and political space.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, aside from a fragment by the great Sophist Gorgias that we will look at in a little while&#x2014;and Gorgias is one of the heroes of this book&#x2014;and Aristophanes&#x2019; <i>The Frogs, </i>where he stages a debate between Euripides and Aeschylus as to who is the best tra�gedian that I will discuss in Part 5, the only spectator reports on tragedy that we possess come from Plato and Aristotle, who had various axes to grind. In the case of Plato, it is a little like basing your view of the Vikings on the reports of the Christian monks whose monasteries they ransacked. Aristotle appears more benev�olent, but appearances can be deceptive. Despite some wonderful and important historical, philological, and archeological work, we have little idea how tragedy was <i>seen </i>and what the audience <i>thought</i>. We have no online reviews, no blogs, and no tweets. Nor do we even know for sure who attended the plays. For example, we cannot be certain whether any women attended the festivals where the tragedies were performed with such an abundance of female characters. But, in my view, far from being a vice, this epis�temic deficit, this lack of knowledge is, I think, a virtue. Tragedy, for me, is the life of skepticism, where the latter is the index for a certain moral orientation in the world, an orientation that seems to emerge from the <i>disorientation </i>of not knowing what to do. I hope to make good on this thought as we move through the following chapters.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a lecture delivered in Oxford in 1908, Wilamowitz&#x2014;Nietzsche&#x2019;s nemesis, who savaged some of the questionable philo�logical claims of <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>&#x2014;said,<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>The tradition yields us only ruins. The more closely we test and examine them, the more clearly we see how ruinous they are; and out of the ruins no whole can be built. The tradition is dead; our task is to revivify life that has passed away. We know that ghosts cannot speak until they have drunk blood; and the spirits which we evoke demand the blood of our hearts. We give it to them gladly.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, the irony here is that Nietzsche says the same thing, namely that it is our blood that makes the ancients speak to us. Without wanting to piggyback on the dizzying recent success of vampire fiction, the latter&#x2019;s portion of truth is that the ancients need a little of our true blood in order to speak to us. When revived, we will notice that when the ancients speak, they do not merely tell us about themselves. They tell us about us. But who is that &#x201c;us&#x201d; that might still be claimed and compelled by these ancient texts, by these ruins? And here is both the beauty and strangeness of this thought: This &#x201c;us&#x201d; is not necessarily existent. It is us, but in some new way, some alien manner. It is us, but not as we have seen ourselves before, turned inside out and upside down.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another way of putting this is to say that the &#x201c;we&#x201d; that we find in tragedy is <i>invitational</i>, an invitation to visit another sense of who we are and who we might become. I borrow this thought from Bernard Williams&#x2019;s <i>Shame and Necessity, </i>to which I will return in the following chapter. The idea of invitation has been interestingly developed by Raymond Geuss in the eponymous, final chapter of his <i>A World without Why </i>as a kind of procedure, if not a method. For Geuss, one is invited to look at two or more things placed in conjunction without necessarily asking the ques�tion why this is the case or seeking for a cause. A pile of dead bod�ies in a ditch in Iraq is placed alongside the prime minister of the United Kingdom speaking oleaginously in the House of Com�mons. Here, the idea of invitation can produce an unexpected juxtaposition or disjunction that provokes thinking. In my view, tragedy invites its audience to look at such disjunctions between two or more claims to truth, justice, or whatever without imme�diately seeking a unifying ground or reconciling the phenomena into a higher unity.<br>&nbsp;<br>My concern in thinking about tragedy and what I will call &#x201c;tragedy&#x2019;s philosophy&#x201d; is to extend an invitation to you to become part of a &#x201c;we,&#x201d; the &#x201c;we&#x201d; that is summoned and called into question by ancient tragedy. More simply stated, every generation has to reinvent the classics. I think it is the responsibility of every gen�eration to engage in this reinvention. And it is the very opposite of any and all kinds of cultural conservatism. If we don&#x2019;t accept this invitation, then we risk becoming even more stupefied by the present and endless onrush of the future. The nice thing is that stupefaction can be really easily avoided by nothing more difficult than reading, and most of the plays are not even that long, which is one reason why I like reading plays. Indeed, although this might sound pompous, I see this as the responsibility of each generation: to pass on something of the deep and unknown past in a way that will speak to the present and arrest us momentarily from the irre�sistible pull of the future. If the disavowal of the past through the endless production of the new is the very formula for ideology in our societies, then tragedy provides enduring resources for a critique of that ideology that might at least allow for the imagina�tion of a different range of human possibilities. First, however, we need to reach for the emergency brake: STOP!</p><h2>Knitting With Balls: A Hands-On Guide to Knitting for the Modern Man</h2><p>A detailed guide to knitting specially designed for male knitters and women looking for the latest patterns for men features twenty-five hip and stylish projects for men, ranging from the Beer Cozy to the Banker&#39;s Vest, along with easy-to-knit accessories, project difficulty ratings, easy-to-follow designs and instructions, a stitch index, and expert tips and advice. Original.</p><p>Michael Del Vecchio works for the non-profit organization Americans for the Arts in Washington D.C. and teaches knitting at Knit and Stitch in Bethesda, MD on weekends. He is the co-creator of the website MenKnit.net, a community-building resource for male knitters built on the motto: &#34;Man Enough to Knit, Strong Enough to Purl.&#34;*Starred Review* Debbie Stoller's <i>Stitch 'n Bitch </i>oldly announced knitting was no longer for grandma. Girls everywhere were picking up their needles and stitching, reclaiming this "domestic art" as hip and modern. Well it's time to shake things up again and dispel the myth that knitting is a girl thing. Men knit and they have for ages. Sailors knit aboard fishing boats, cowboys knit while tending cattle and surgeons knit to keep their fingers nimble. Men have knitted from the beginning of knitting. When the stigma of knitting as a women's craft began is unclear, but it hasn't kept men from knitting. Still, resources for male knitters are limited. Most pattern books are filled with projects for women and children, providing only a few patterns for men (usually a hat, scarf and raglan sweater). Del Vecchio has collected a wonderful selection of modern patterns for men, giving the book appeal not just to men interested in knitting but also to women looking for more patterns for men. Readers are encouraged to spread the word that men knit--knit in public, start a men-only knitting group, participate in online communities. Resource lists of books, Web sites, and yarns, as well as advice on how to start your own knitting group, are provided at the end of the book. An essential addition to any knitting library, not just because it challenges our ideas of his-and-her crafts but also because of the stunning, modern patterns inside. <i>Jennifer Palmer</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By 476 the Roman empire had vanished from western Europe; by 655 the Persian empire had vanished from the Near East. Mr. Brown, Professor of History at Princeton University, examines these changes and men's reactions to them, but his account shows that the period was also one of outstanding new beginnings and defines the far-reaching impact both of Christianity on Europe and of Islam on the Near East. The result is a lucid answer to a crucial question in world history; how the exceptionally homogeneous Mediterranean world of c. 200 A.D. became divided into the three mutually estranged societies of the Middle Ages: Catholic Western Europe, Byzantium, and Islam. We still live with the results of these contrasts.</p><p>Peter Brown (Ph.D. Oxford University) is the Rollins Professor of History at Princeton University. He previously taught at London University and the University of California, Berkeley. He has written on the rise of Christianity and the end of the Roman empire. His works include: Augustine of Hippo (1967); The World of Late Antiquity (1972); The Cult of the Saints (1981); Body and Society (1988), The Rise of Western Christendom (1995 and 2002); Poverty and Leadership in the Later Roman Empire (2002). He is presently working on issues of wealth and poverty in the late Roman and early medieval Christian world.</p><h2>The Way of the Masks</h2><p>Claude Levi-Strauss&#x2019;s fascination with Northwest Coast Indian art dates back to the late 1930s. &#x201c;Sometime before the outbreak of the Second World War,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;I had already bought in Paris a Haida slate panel pipe.&#x201d; In New York in the early forties, he shared his enthusiasm with a group of Surrealist refugee artists with whom he was associated. &#x201c;Surely it will not be long,&#x201d; he wrote in an article published in 1943, &#x201c;before we see the collections from this part of the world moved from ethnographic to fine arts museums to take their just place amidst the antiquities of Egypt of Persia and the works of medieval Europe. For this art is not unequal to the greatest, and, in the course of the century and a half of its history that is known to us, it has shown evidence of a superior diversity and has demonstrated apparently inexhaustible talents for renewal.&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>The Way of the Masks</i>, first published more than thirty years later, he returned to this material, seeking to unravel a persistent problem that he associated with a particular mask, the Swaihwe, which is found among certain tribes of coastal British Columbia. This book, now available for the first time in an English translation, is a vivid, audacious illustration of Levi-Strauss&#x2019;s provocative structural approach to tribal art and culture.<br><br>Bringing to bear on the Swaihwe masks his theory that mythical representations cannot be understood as isolated objects, Levi-Strausss began to look for links among them, as well as relationships between these and other types of masks and myths, treating them all as parts of a dialogue that has been going on for generations among neighboring tribes. The wider system that emerges form his investigation uncovers the association of the masks with Northwest coppers and with hereditary status and wealth, and takes the reader as far north as the Dene of Alaska, as far south as the Yurok of northern California, and as far away in time and space as medieval Europe.

Good thing he&#x2019;s also brilliant, rich, and (some people might say) handsome, or he&#x2019;d probably be homeless.&nbsp;Riley Moon has just graduated from Harvard Business and Harvard Law. Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude has helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst with mega-bank Blane-Grunwald. At least Riley Moon <i>thought</i> it was her dream job, until she is given her first assignment: babysitting Emerson Knight.<br> &nbsp;<br> What starts off as an inquiry about missing bank funds in the Knight account leads to inquiries about a missing man, missing gold, and a life-and-death race across the country. Through the streets of Washington, D.C., and down into the underground vault of the Federal Reserve in New York City, an evil plan is exposed. A plan so sinister that only a megalomaniac could think it up, and only the unlikely duo of the irrepressibly charming Emerson Knight and the tenacious Riley Moon can stop it.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Curious Minds</i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;The one-liners fly at a ferocious pace. . . .

The light beam reflected back into his eyes so intensely that he had to squint. He moved closer and touched the surface of the twelve-foot tower of solid gold bricks. There were thousands of them, some dented and battered, some pristine and fresh. All of them shining like new, because gold never tarnishes.<br> There had been a time when G�nter loved gold. But that was before he knew the truth. That was before his search for gold led him to this miserable damp cavern. Far off, he could hear the echoing sound of water dripping onto the cave floor. Aside from that steady drip, drip, drip, the silence surrounding him was complete and claustrophobic.<br><br> He stood statue-still, awed and horrified by the quantity of gold stacked in front of him. In the all-encompassing silence there was a sigh that didn&#x2019;t emanate from his body. G�nter killed his light and waited in the pitch-black, straining his ears for the noise to repeat itself. His heart pounded against his rib cage, and cold fear crawled along his backbone. His testicles had retreated far into his body. Maybe to the point of no return. Not his biggest worryright now. If he was found in the cave it would mean certain death. He caught the faint rustle of cloth and the click of a light switch. Harsh halogen work lamps flashed on and illuminated the grotto.<br><br> For the first time G�nter was able to see the length and breadth of the storage space. Golden walls had been erected, as if King Midas was building an underground maze. Stalactites and stalagmites, looking like the teeth of some subterranean monster, partially obscured the view. G�nter was overwhelmed with regret. He should never have come here. He&#x2019;d driven thousands of miles to get to this godforsaken place. What the heck was he thinking? He was just a middle-aged banker with high blood pressure and low self-esteem. He had no business playing amateur detective. He should have gone to the authorities as soon as he began to suspect. Problem was, the authorities were the ones he suspected.<br><br> There! He saw a shadow moving among the towering limestone columns. The figure of a short man. A man who moved with the grace of a cat, his footfalls making no sound on the cavern floor. The man stepped into the light, and G�nter felt a chill rip through him, felt the contents of his intestines liquefy. The man was bald and had bulging eyes. G�nter knew the man. And he knew that the man was looking for him, and that the man was capable of doing terrible things.<br><br> G�nter was hidden behind a stack of gold bricks. He shrank back and scanned the area, looking for an escape route. He crept to the end of his protective stack, turned a corner, and almost tripped over a body. It was a woman. Her dead eyes were open wide with terror and the top of her head was caved in. A gold bar lay beside her, matted with hair and blood.<br><br> G�nter gagged and clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from moaning out loud. He recognized the woman. She was Yvette Jaworski. And he knew he was partly responsible for her horrible death. He turned to run and came face to face with the bald man . . . and the shiny scalpel in his hand.<br><br> &#x201c;G�nter, you picked the wrong place to go exploring,&#x201d; the man said, in a soft, silky voice.<br> G�nter would have agreed if he&#x2019;d had the chance.<br><br> &nbsp;<br><b>CHAPTER ONE<br></b><br> Riley Moon parked her Mini Cooper in the circular driveway and gaped at the house in front of her. She thought it looked as if it had been designed by the witch from &#x201c;Hansel and Gretel&#x201d; after she&#x2019;d made a killing in the stock market. Its steeply pitched roof, multicolored shingles, odd turrets, and sprawling, ungainly porch made it both inviting and ominous. It was located at the end of a long private drive that wound through a heavily wooded section of Rock Creek Park. It was one of the biggest mansions in Washington, D.C., and it was appropriately called Mysterioso Manor. Emerson Knight, the resident owner, was appropriately known as a nutcase.<br><br> Knight had ignored requests that he visit the bank to discuss his recently inherited fortune and to choose a new personal banker, so the bank had dispatched Riley to assure Emerson that his money was in good hands.<br><br> &nbsp;Riley maneuvered herself out of the Mini, straightened the hem of her fitted cream-colored Akris jacket, and planted her four-inch Valentino heels on the gravel driveway. It was her second week as a junior analyst at Blane-Grunwald, the mega-bank that made Goldman Sachs look like a mom-and-pop savings and loan. She&#x2019;d taken the time to get degrees from Harvard Business and Harvard Law, and now at age twenty-eight she was finally ready to set the world on fire. She was going to make her family proud, pay off her gazillion student loans, and carve out a brilliant career. And she was moving closer to her goals on this perfect September morning.<br><br> She was two steps from the massive porch when the front door to the mansion burst open and a frazzled woman stormed out, swept past Riley without a word, and headed down the driveway.<br> A tall, rangy woman in her midsixties stood on the porch and waved at the angry woman. <br><br>&#x201c;Danielle, give it one more chance!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No! No more chances!&#x201d; Danielle yelled back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all whacko. And I&#x2019;m not cleaning up after no damn armadillo.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;At least let me give you a ride home!&#x201d; the tall woman pleaded.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather walk,&#x201d; Danielle said, stomping around the bend in the road, disappearing from sight.<br> Riley thought that the tall woman looked like she&#x2019;d just stepped out of the Dust Bowl. Her hair was mostly gray and piled on top of her head with a bunch of strands escaping. No makeup. Beat-up running shoes, loose-fitting jeans, and an untucked though neatly ironed floral-patterned faded pink shirt.<br><br> The woman sighed and turned to Riley. &#x201c;Sorry you had to hear that, hon, but Danielle had a right to get her tail feathers ruffled.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did she say something about an armadillo?&#x201d;<br><br> The tall woman looked at her with stoic resignation. &#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley extended her hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Riley Moon from Blane- Grunwald bank. I&#x2019;m here to see Emerson Knight. He&#x2019;s expecting me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Emmie&#x2019;s Aunt Myra. Come on in. Nice to see a pretty girl stopping by, even if it is just business. And look at you with all that curly red hair and big brown eyes. And you got a nose that&#x2019;s cute as a button. I bet you work out too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I like to run when I get the chance. It clears my mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m glad to see you here. Emmie doesn&#x2019;t have many visitors these days.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley liked that this woman called Emerson Knight, one of the richest men in the country, plain old &#x201c;Emmie.&#x201d;<br><br> Maybe the rumors she&#x2019;d heard were untrue. Maybe he wasn&#x2019;t as aloof and eccentric as the press reported.<br><br> Myra turned back to the door and gave a disgusted grunt. &#x201c;The dang thing closed behind me,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> She tried the handle. Locked. She entered a number into the keypad beside the door. Still locked. She tried another number. Nothing.<br><br> &#x201c;Shoot,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;This is supposed to be a smart house.<br><br> Why isn&#x2019;t it smart enough to let me in?&#x201d;<br><br> Myra shifted in front of the camera that was part of the keypad, pushed a button, and said, &#x201c;Hello, Emmie,&#x201d; a little too loud, like Riley&#x2019;s mother did when she talked on a cellphone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m locked out again.&#x201d;<br><br> A man&#x2019;s voice came over the intercom. &#x201c;Aunt Myra? Is that you?&#x201d;<br><br> The man sounded distracted, as if he had just been pulled away from finding a cure for cancer or a marathon binge-watching of Game of Thrones.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Aunt Myra answered. &#x201c;Did you change the password?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I might have.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What did you change it to?&#x201d; Aunt Myra asked, patiently.<br><br> &#x201c;I have no idea. Who&#x2019;s that with you?&#x201d;<br><br> Riley leaned into the camera. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Riley Moon, sir. From Blane-Grunwald. You were expecting me, Mr. Knight.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I received a message that a bank representative would be visiting. I didn&#x2019;t respond. I assumed that indicated disinterest.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Let us in, Emmie,&#x201d; Aunt Myra said. &#x201c;Open the door!&#x201d;<br><br> There was a faint click, Myra tried the handle, and the door opened.<br><br> Inside was all dark wood and high ceilings. A huge staircase with blood-red carpet rose up the center of the very formal foyer. The banister was mahogany. The elaborate chandelier and wall sconces were crystal. The side chairs, center hall table, and various chests and side tables were antique and reminded Riley of her gram&#x2019;s Duncan Phyfe dining room set. When Gram passed on, the furniture went to Aunt Rose and Uncle Charlie, and it had looked very grand in the small dining room of their doublewide.<br><br> &#x201c;Just head up the stairs. Go down the hall to your right until you hear the weirdo music,&#x201d; Aunt Myra said to Riley. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be the library. I have to go make lunch. You&#x2019;ll be all right. There&#x2019;s nobody here but Emerson and me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big house. No . . . staff?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, they keep quitting.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley climbed the stairs, and a dark little creature scuttled across the hall in front of her. The armadillo. Riley was from a small, windblown town in Texas, and she was more used to seeing armadillos as roadkill. This one was refreshingly unflattened by an eighteen-wheeler. It trotted along the carpeted hallway like some alien from another planet, its shell bobbing up and down as it moved. Okay, so it&#x2019;s a little odd, Riley thought, but it was adorable all the same.<br><br> She&#x2019;d been anticipating an eerie organ fugue, or monks singing Gregorian chants, or perhaps New Age music played on a pan flute. The music blasting out of the library was 1970s go-go funk.<br> &#x201c;I feel like bustin&#x2019; loose. Bustin&#x2019; loose!&#x201d;<br><br> Riley entered the library and looked around. The room was gigantic. A lot more dark wood. An intricate parquet floor, inlaid to look like a giant chessboard. A fancy circular wrought iron staircase led up to a balcony. The balcony encircled the entire room and provided access to two levels of towering carved oak bookshelves. A huge domed ceiling loomed above her, featuring an eighteenth-century Italian fresco. A large weather-beaten Coleman tent had been set up in front of a massive stone fireplace.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Riley called, not seeing anyone in the room. &#x201c;Knock, knock?&#x201d;<br><br> She crossed the room and peeked inside the tent. No one there, but it was very cozy with brightly colored silk prayer flags hanging from the sides and peaked roof. A lightweight sleeping bag was neatly laid out on a camp cot. A small wooden meditation bench and an altar hugged another wall. There were fresh flowers and some photographs on the altar.<br><br> Riley turned away from the tent and bumped into Emerson Knight, spearing his foot with her spike heel.<br><br> &#x201c;Crap on a cracker!&#x201d; she said, jumping away.<br><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an interesting exclamation,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is that regional to Texas? You have a definite Texas accent.&#x201d;<br><br> Whoa, Riley thought. The man was gorgeous. He was about six two and lean. He was wearing loose-fitting gray cords, brown Converse All Star sneakers, and a gray T-shirt that was loose enough to be comfortable and tight enough for Riley to see he was ripped. He had a lot of wavy black hair, and dark eyes that could only be described as smoldering. He looked like the cover of a romance novel come to life. This was a complete surprise, as it wasn&#x2019;t in the bio she&#x2019;d been given. She&#x2019;d expected Emerson Knight to look like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry!&#x201d; she said.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfectly all right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The pain lets me know that I&#x2019;m alive. Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see you there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Entirely my fault. I was exercising my power to cloud your mind, so you couldn&#x2019;t see me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all. In fact, I almost never joke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh boy,&#x201d; Riley said.<br><br>&#x201c;What does that imply?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It implies that I don&#x2019;t believe you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see me?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There you have it.&#x201d;<br><br>Riley decided the man was physically a ten, but intellectually he was a certifiable fruit basket. Probably did astral projection to Mars in his spare time. She sucked in some air and did a mental reboot, going into her rehearsed speech.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Knight, Blane-Grunwald considers you one of our most valued clients.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m really, really rich,&#x201d; Emerson Knight said.<br><br>Not seeming to brag but simply stating the facts. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Riley said. The facts were the facts.<br> Crossing to a huge wooden library table, Emerson sat down in a spindly Louis XIV chair and gestured for Riley to join him at the table.<br><br>&#x201c;At the risk of sounding rude, I see no purpose for your visit,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve repeatedly requested a meeting with G�nter Grunwald. Obviously you aren&#x2019;t G�nter Grunwald. I find this all quite odd.&#x201d;<br><br>Riley perched on a chair across from Emerson. &#x201c;Mr. Grunwald is out of the office for a few days. Personal leave. I&#x2019;ve been instructed to give you any assistance you might need in his absence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been more than a few days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Many days?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. That would be more accurate. G�nter always managed my family&#x2019;s assets, including our gold holdings. And now that my father&#x2019;s dead and the estate has been settled . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know this is a difficult time for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Riley&#x2019;s superior had prepared that line for her, knowing that Emerson&#x2019;s father had died just eight months ago.<br><br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;My father and I were never close. And now that I&#x2019;ve inherited the family fortune, I see that it has dwindled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The economic downturn has been rough on everyone,&#x201d; Riley said. She&#x2019;d been coached on that line, too. &#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;re concerned about the state of your portfolio, and I want to assure you that your personal assets are in competent hands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care about my personal assets,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more than enough for me. The foundation that controls charitable contributions is in disarray, and I do care about that. The foundation funds several positions at three different hospitals. We support leukemia research at Massachusetts General Hospital. We maintain no-kill animal shelters throughout the country. We run food banks and shelters for the homeless. We support the arts. It&#x2019;s now my personal responsibility that the foundation stays financially healthy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For some time now I&#x2019;ve been having doubts about the management and security of my assets. These doubts are disturbing my intellectual equilibrium.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s uncomfortable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;What it comes down to is . . . I want my gold.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My gold,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;The family&#x2019;s gold holdings. I want to withdraw them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t think you mean that literally.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do. I mean it literally. Not figuratively.&#x201d;<br><br>Emerson looked at Riley with an expectant expression on his face.<br><br>&#x201c;You act as if we keep the gold in a vault in the bank,&#x201d; Riley said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course, but it might not be in the D.C. bank,&#x201d; Riley said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nevertheless, I want it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just withdraw the gold. It isn&#x2019;t done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I look at it?&#x201d;&lt;...</p><h2>Whispers of the Moon: The Life and Work of Scott Cunningham</h2><p>Now you can discover the history and motivations of one of the most influential people in the development of modern Wicca, Scott Cunningham, in <i>Whispers of the Moon </i>by David Harrington and deTraci Regula. <br> <br><i>Whispers of the Moon </i>is Scott Cunningham's unfinished autobiography, completed and expanded by two of his friends and colleagues. Drawing upon Scott's notes and their personal relationships with him, David and deTraci have included everything to understand this philosopher-magician: <br> <br>�Portions of letters <br>�Previously unpublished poems, essays, and photographs <br>�His natal chart <br>�The complete text of <i>A Formula Book of Magical Incenses &amp; Oils <br></i>�Many charming and touching personal anecdotes <br> <br>With magical clarity and gentle wit, Scott's books opened doors for tens of thousands of people. Scott popularized and enhanced the life-affirming path of Wicca in ways that will continue long into the future. Many Wiccans entered into the Craft through his books. Thousands of people cast their first Circle using Scott's words of power. <br> <br><i>Whispers of the Moon</i> is an essential resource including a complete list of Scott's published works, his birth-data and horoscope (not available previously), and remembrances of many people who were touched by his gentle magic. <i>Whispers of the Moon</i> is a unique blend of magical lore, personal anecdotes, and rare insights into the forces that molded Scott's life. <br> <br>Scott Cunningham passed in 1993 into the Summerland and to the Goddess whom he loved and served so well. As the author of over 50 books and as a greatly respected teacher and leader, Scott is missed by his many friends and by people all over the world that learned from his writings. But his work lives on in his books. <i>Whispers of the Moon </i>is the book that links Scott's writings into a whole. You must get it. <br></p><p>David Harrington lives in Chula Vista, California and has a long-term interest in the mysteries of household magic. A student of the sacred sciences since childhood, deTraci Regula explores the mystical through writing, dreams, and art. &nbsp;She has been a Priestess of Isis with the Fellowship of Isis since 1983. &nbsp;With David Harrington, she is the co-author of the upcoming biography of their friend Scott Cunningham, Whispers of the Moon. &nbsp;In addition to work in the animation industry on such secular epics as the animated version of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, she also produced and directed the video programs Herb Magic with Scott Cunningham and Witchcraft: Yesterday and Today with Raymond Buckland. &nbsp;She has traveled to sacred sites in Turkey, China, Japan, and Britain, as well as the United States. <br> <br>When not writing, deTraci Regula practices Taoist painting and exploring the family geneaology. &nbsp;Named for her ancestor William deTraci, deTraci Regula comes from a long line of pagans and freethinkers. &nbsp;One of her ancestors was chastised by the local bishop for "consorting magically with the horses," though what that means exactly has been mysteriously excised from the family histories. &nbsp;Another ancestor, a Protestant during the reign of the Catholic Queen, "Bloody" Mary, was dug up and burned as a heretic after his death because of certain comments he made in his last will and testament. <br> ~</p><h2>Streets of San Francisco: The Origins of Street and Place Names</h2><p>From its origins as the Spanish village of Yerba Buena (&#34;good herb&#34;) to its present status as the cultural and commercial center of the West, San Francisco&#39;s heritage is reflected in its historic street names.

Best-selling novelists J. K. Rowling and Dan Brown, popular historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Stephen Ambrose, Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree, first novelist Kaavya Viswanathan: all have rightly or wrongly been accused of plagiarism&#x2013;theft of intellectual property&#x2013;provoking widespread media punditry. But what exactly is plagiarism? How has the meaning of this notoriously ambiguous term changed over time as a consequence of historical and cultural transformations? Is the practice on the rise, or just more easily detectable by technological advances? How does the current market for expressive goods inform our own understanding of plagiarism? Is there really such a thing as &#x201c;cryptomnesia,&#x201d; the unconscious, unintentional appropriation of another&#x2019;s work? What are the mysterious motives and curious excuses of plagiarists? What forms of punishment and absolution does this &#x201c;sin&#x201d; elicit? What is the good in certain types of plagiarism?<br><br>Provocative, insightful, and extraordinary for its clarity and forthrightness, <i>The Little Book of Plagiarism </i>is an analytical tour de force in small, the work of &#x201c;one of the top twenty legal thinkers in America&#x201d; (<i>Legal Affairs</i>), a distinguished jurist renowned for his adventuresome intellect and daring iconoclasm.</p><p>Richard A. Posner is a judge on the United States Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. Judge Posner has written many works on jurisprudence and legal philosophy, as well as books and articles on issues of moment, including <i>An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton; Breaking the Deadlock: The 2000 Election, the Constitution, and the Courts; Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline; Preventing Surprise Attacks: Intelligence Reform in the Wake of 9/11; </i>and<i> Catastrophe: Risk and Response</i>. He lives in Chicago.Not all plagiarized authors will agree with Posner's conclusion that plagiarism is an "embarrassingly second-rate" offense, "its practitioners... pathetic," and that plagiarism should remain an ethical rather than a legal offense, punished by public shaming. But in a fascinating historical tour of the subject, he dismisses the idea that good art must be totally original. Shakespeare stole the plot of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and Manet's <i>Olympia </i>is a reworking of Titian's <i>Venus d'Urbino&#x2014;</i>both examples of what Posner calls "creative imitation." But focusing on Kaavya Viswanathan novel, <i>How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life</i>, Posner (<i>Uncertain Shield</i>), a judge on the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and expert on intellectual property, says this was a particularly modern, market-driven form of plagiarism: Viswanathan was attempting to compete against Megan McCafferty in the chick lit market by appropriating her competitor's own words. Posner focuses a lot on student plagiarism and seems to think all students should be considered suspect; schools that don't subscribe to detection software like Turnitin, he says, are "na�ve." Indeed, he believes publishers should, and will, begin to use such programs, concluding, optimistically, "We may be entering the twilight of plagiarism." It's unfortunate that Posner briefly brings politics into this important and timely discussion, superciliously accusing the so-called academic left of being "soft on plagiarism." <i>(Jan. 16)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Everyone remembers the smell of their grandmother&#39;s house. Everyone remembers the stories their grandmother told them. But does everyone remember their grandmother flirting with policemen? Driving illegally? Breaking into a zoo in the middle of the night? Firing a paintball gun from a balcony in her dressing gown? Seven-year-old Elsa does. Some might call Elsa&#39;s granny &#39;eccentric&#39;, or even &#39;crazy&#39;. Elsa calls her a superhero. And granny&#39;s stories, of knights and princesses and dragons and castles, are her superpower. Because, as Elsa is starting to learn, heroes and villains don&#39;t always exist in imaginary kingdoms; they could live just down the hallway. As Christmas draws near, even the best superhero grandmothers may have one or two things they&#39;d like to apologise for. And, in the process, Elsa can have some breath-taking adventures of her own . . .</p><p>Fredrik Backman is a Swedish blogger, columnist and author. His debut novel A MAN CALLED OVE was a number 1 bestseller across Scandinavia, has sold over one million copies worldwide, was a Richard &amp; Judy summer read in the UK and an instant New York Times paperback bestseller, and has been made into an acclaimed film. Fredrik's subsequent novels, MY GRANDMOTHER SENDS HER REGARDS AND APOLOGISES and BRITT-MARIE WAS HERE, also went straight to number 1 in Sweden on publication.My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She&#x2019;s Sorry 1<p></p> <br><br> TOBACCO<p></p> <br>Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That&#x2019;s just how it is.<br> <br>Anyone who doesn&#x2019;t agree needs their head examined.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what Elsa&#x2019;s granny says, at least.<br> <br>Elsa is seven, going on eight. She knows she isn&#x2019;t especially good at being seven. She knows she&#x2019;s different. Her headmaster says she needs to &#x201c;fall into line&#x201d; in order to achieve &#x201c;a better fit with her peers.&#x201d; Other adults describe her as &#x201c;very grown-up for her age.&#x201d; Elsa knows this is just another way of saying &#x201c;massively annoying for her age,&#x201d; because they only tend to say this when she corrects them for mispronouncing &#x201c;d�j� vu&#x201d; or not being able to tell the difference between &#x201c;me&#x201d; and &#x201c;I&#x201d; at the end of a sentence. Smart-asses usually can&#x2019;t, hence the &#x201c;grown-up for her age&#x201d; comment, generally said with a strained smile at her parents. As if she has a mental impairment, as if Elsa has shown them up by not being totally thick just because she&#x2019;s seven. And that&#x2019;s why she doesn&#x2019;t have any friends except Granny. Because all the other seven-year-olds in her school are as idiotic as seven-year-olds tend to be, but Elsa is different.<br> <br>She shouldn&#x2019;t take any notice of what those muppets think, says Granny. Because all the best people are different&#x2014;look at superheroes. After all, if superpowers were normal, everyone would have them.<br> <br>Granny is seventy-seven years old, going on seventy-eight. She&#x2019;s not very good at it either. You can tell she&#x2019;s old because her face looks like newspaper stuffed into wet shoes, but no one ever accuses Granny of being grown-up for her age. &#x201c;Perky,&#x201d; people sometimes say to Elsa&#x2019;s mum, looking either fairly worried or fairly angry as Mum sighs and asks how much she owes for the damages. Or when Granny&#x2019;s smoking at the hospital sets the fire alarm off and she starts ranting and raving about how &#x201c;everything has to be so bloody politically correct these days!&#x201d; when the security guards make her extinguish her cigarette. Or that time she made a snowman in Britt-Marie and Kent&#x2019;s garden right under their balcony and dressed it up in grown-up clothes so it looked as if a person had fallen from the roof. Or that time those prim men wearing spectacles started ringing all the doorbells and wanted to talk about God and Jesus and heaven, and Granny stood on her balcony with her dressing gown flapping open, shooting at them with her paintball gun, and Britt-Marie couldn&#x2019;t quite decide if she was most annoyed about the paintball-gun thing or the not-wearing-anything-under-the-dressing-gown thing, but she reported both to the police just to be on the safe side.<br> <br>Those are the times, Elsa supposes, that people find Granny perky for her age.<br> <br>They also say that Granny is mad, but in actual fact she&#x2019;s a genius. It&#x2019;s just that she&#x2019;s a bit of a crackpot at the same time. She used to be a doctor, and she won prizes and journalists wrote articles about her and she went to all the most terrible places in the world when everyone else was getting out. She saved lives and fought evil everywhere on earth. As superheroes do.<br> <br>But one day someone decided she was too old to save lives, even if Elsa quite strongly suspects what they really meant by &#x201c;too old&#x201d; was &#x201c;too crazy.&#x201d; Granny refers to this person as &#x201c;Society&#x201d; and says it&#x2019;s only because everything has to be so bloody politically correct nowadays that she&#x2019;s no longer allowed to make incisions in people. And that it was really mainly about Society getting so bleeding fussy about the smoking ban in the operating theaters, and who could work under those sorts of conditions?<br> <br>So now she&#x2019;s mainly at home driving Britt-Marie and Mum around the bend. Britt-Marie is Granny&#x2019;s neighbor, Mum is Elsa&#x2019;s mum. And really Britt-Marie is also Elsa&#x2019;s mum&#x2019;s neighbor because Elsa&#x2019;s mum lives next door to Elsa&#x2019;s granny. And Elsa obviously also lives next door to Granny, because Elsa lives with her mum. Except every other weekend, when she lives with Dad and Lisette. And of course George is also Granny&#x2019;s neighbor, because he lives with Mum. It&#x2019;s a bit all over the place.<br> <br>But anyway, to get back to the point: lifesaving and driving people nuts are Granny&#x2019;s superpowers. Which perhaps makes her a bit of a dysfunctional superhero. Elsa knows this because she looked up &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; on Wikipedia. People of Granny&#x2019;s age describe Wikipedia as &#x201c;an encyclopedia, but on the net!&#x201d; Encyclopedias are what Elsa describes as &#x201c;Wikipedia, but analog.&#x201d; Elsa has checked &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; in both places and it means that something is not quite functioning as it&#x2019;s supposed to. Which is one of Elsa&#x2019;s favorite things about her granny.<br> <br>But maybe not today. Because it&#x2019;s half past one in the morning and Elsa is fairly tired and would really like to go back to bed. Except that&#x2019;s not going to happen, because Granny&#x2019;s been throwing turds at a policeman.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a little complicated.<br> <br><br> <br>Elsa looks around the little rectangular room and yawns listlessly and so widely that she looks like she&#x2019;s trying to swallow her own head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did tell you not to climb the fence,&#x201d; she mutters, checking her watch.<br> <br>Granny doesn&#x2019;t answer. Elsa takes off her Gryffindor scarf and puts it in her lap. She was born on Boxing Day seven years ago (almost eight). The same day some German scientists recorded the strongest-ever emission of gamma radiation from a magnetar over the earth. Admittedly Elsa doesn&#x2019;t know what a magnetar is, but it&#x2019;s some kind of neutron star. And it sounds a little like &#x201c;Megatron,&#x201d; which is the name of the evil one in Transformers, which is what simpletons who don&#x2019;t read enough quality literature call &#x201c;a children&#x2019;s program.&#x201d; In actual fact the Transformers are robots, but if you look at it academically they could also be counted as superheroes. Elsa is very keen on both Transformers and neutron stars, and she imagines that an &#x201c;emission of gamma radiation&#x201d; would look a bit like that time Granny spilled Fanta on Elsa&#x2019;s iPhone and tried to dry it out in the toaster. And Granny says it makes Elsa special to have been born on a day like that. And being special is the best way of being different.<br> <br>Granny is busy distributing small heaps of tobacco all over the wooden table in front of her and rolling them into rustling cigarette papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said I told you not to climb the fence!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny makes a snorting sound and searches the pockets of her much-too-large overcoat for a lighter. She doesn&#x2019;t seem to be taking any of this very seriously, mainly because she never seems to take anything seriously. Except when she wants to smoke and can&#x2019;t find a lighter.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a tiny little fence, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; she says breezily. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing to get worked up about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you &#x2018;for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2019; me! You&#x2019;re the one who threw shit at the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop fussing. You sound like your mother. Do you have a lighter?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m seven!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long are you going to use that as an excuse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Until I&#x2019;m not seven anymore?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny mumbles something that sounds like &#x201c;Not a crime to ask, is it?&#x201d; and continues rifling through her pockets.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you can smoke in here, actually,&#x201d; Elsa informs her, sounding calmer now and fingering the long rip in the Gryffindor scarf.<br> <br>&#x201c;Course you can smoke. We&#x2019;ll just open a window.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa looks skeptically at the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re the sort of windows that open.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got bars on them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny glares with dissatisfaction at the windows. And then at Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;So now you can&#x2019;t even smoke at the police station. Jesus. It&#x2019;s like being in 1984.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa yawns again. &#x201c;Can I borrow your phone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To check something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Online.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You invest too much time on that Internet stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean, &#x2018;spend.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What I mean is, you don&#x2019;t use &#x2018;invest&#x2019; in that way. You wouldn&#x2019;t go round saying, &#x2018;I invested two hours in reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x2019;s Stone,&#x2019; would you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny just rolls her eyes and hands her the phone. &#x201c;Did you ever hear about the girl who blew up because she did too much thinking?&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman who shuffles into the room looks very, very tired.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to call my lawyer,&#x201d; Granny demands at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to call my mum!&#x201d; Elsa demands at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;In that case I want to call my lawyer first!&#x201d; Granny insists.<br> <br>The policeman sits down opposite them and fidgets with a little pile of papers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your mother is on her way,&#x201d; he says to Elsa with a sigh.<br> <br>Granny makes the sort of dramatic gasp that only Granny knows how to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you call her? Are you mad?&#x201d; she protests, as if the policeman just told her he was going to leave Elsa in the forest to be raised by a pack of wolves. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be bloody livid!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have to call the child&#x2019;s legal guardian,&#x201d; the policeman explains calmly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am also the child&#x2019;s legal guardian! I am the child&#x2019;s grandmother!&#x201d; Granny fumes, rising slightly out of her chair and shaking her unlit cigarette menacingly.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s half past one in the morning. Someone has to take care of the child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, me! I&#x2019;m taking care of the child!&#x201d; she splutters.<br> <br>The policeman makes a fairly strained attempt to gesture amicably across the interrogation room.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how do you feel it&#x2019;s going so far?&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny looks slightly offended.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . everything was going just fine until you started chasing me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You broke into a zoo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a tiny little fence&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing as a &#x2018;tiny&#x2019; burglary.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny shrugs and makes a brushing movement over the table, as if she thinks they&#x2019;ve stretched this out long enough. The policeman notices the cigarette and eyes it dubiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on! I can smoke in here, can&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shakes his head sternly. Granny leans forward, looks him deep in the eyes, and smiles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you make an exception? Not even for little old me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa gives Granny a little shove in the side and switches to their secret language. Because Granny and Elsa have a secret language, as all grannies must have with their grandchildren, because by law that&#x2019;s a requirement, says Granny. Or at least it should be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop it, Granny. It&#x2019;s, like, illegal to flirt with policemen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Says who?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, the police for starters!&#x201d; Elsa replies.<br> <br>&#x201c;The police are supposed to be there for the sake of the citizens,&#x201d; Granny hisses. &#x201c;I pay my taxes, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman looks at them as you do when a seven-year-old and a seventy-seven-year-old start arguing in a secret language in a police station in the middle of the night. Then Granny&#x2019;s eyelashes tremble alluringly at him as she once again points pleadingly at her cigarette, but when he shakes his head, Granny leans back in the chair and exclaims in normal language:<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean, this political correctness! It&#x2019;s worse than apartheid for smokers in this bloody country nowadays!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you spell that?&#x201d; asks Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Granny sighs as you do when precisely the whole world is against you, even though you pay taxes.<br> <br>&#x201c;That apartight thing,&#x201d; says Elsa.<br> <br>&#x201c;A-p-p-a-r-t-e-i-d,&#x201d; Granny spells.<br> <br>Elsa immediately Googles it on Granny&#x2019;s phone. It takes her a few attempts&#x2014;Granny&#x2019;s always been a terrible speller. Meanwhile the policeman explains that they&#x2019;ve decided to let them go, but Granny will be called in at a later date to explain the burglary and &#x201c;other aggravations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What aggravations?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Driving illegally, to begin with.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, illegally? That&#x2019;s my car! I don&#x2019;t need permission to drive my own car, do I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; replies the policeman patiently, &#x201c;but you need a driver&#x2019;s license.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny throws out her arms in exasperation. She&#x2019;s just launched into another rant about this being a Big Brother society when Elsa whacks the phone sharply against the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got NOTHING to do with that apartheid thing!!! You compared not being able to smoke with apartheid and it&#x2019;s not the same thing at all. It&#x2019;s not even CLOSE!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny waves her hand resignedly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I meant it was . . . you know, more or less like that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t at all!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was a metaphor, for God&#x2019;s sake&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A bloody crap metaphor!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How would you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;WIKIPEDIA!&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny turns in defeat to the policeman. &#x201c;Do your children carry on like this?&#x201d; The policeman looks uncomfortable.<br> <br>&#x201c;We . . . don&#x2019;t let the children surf the Net unsupervised. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny stretches out her arms towards Elsa, a gesture that seems to say &#x201c;You see!&#x201d; Elsa just shakes her head and crosses her arms very hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Granny, just say sorry for throwing turds at the police, and we can go home,&#x201d; she snorts in the secret language, though still very expressly upset about that whole apartheid thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; says Granny in the secret language.<br> <br>&#x201c;To the police, not me, you muppet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be no apologizing to fascists here. I pay my taxes. And you&#x2019;re the muppet.&#x201d; Granny sulks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Takes one to know one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then they both sit with their arms crossed, demonstratively looking away from each other, until Granny nods at the policeman and says in normal language:<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you be kind enough to let my spoilt granddaughter know that if she takes this attitude, she&#x2019;s quite welcome to walk home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her I&#x2019;m going home with Mum and she&#x2019;s the one who can walk!&#x201d; Elsa replies at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell HER she can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The policeman stands up without a word, walks out of the room and closes the door behind him, as if intending to go into another room and bury his head in a large, soft cushion and yell as loud as he can.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now look what you did,&#x201d; says Granny.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look what YOU did!&#x201d;<br> <br>Eventually a heavyset policewoman with piercing green eyes comes in instead. It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be the first time she&#x2019;s run into Granny, because she smiles in that tired way so typical of people who know Granny, and says: &#x201c;You have to stop doing this, we also have real criminals to worry about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Granny just mumbles, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you stop, yourselves?&#x201d; And then they&#x2019;re allowed to go home.<br> <br>Standing on the pavement waiting for her mother, Elsa fingers the rip in her scarf. It goes right through the Gryffindor emblem. She tries as hard as she can not to cry but doesn&#x2019;t make much of a success of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, come on, your mum can mend that,&#x201d; says Granny, trying to be cheerful, giving her a little punch on the shoulder.<br> <br>Elsa looks up anxiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;And, you know . . . we can tell your mum the scarf got torn when you were trying to stop me climbing the fence to get to the monkeys.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa nods and runs her fingers over the scarf again. It didn&#x2019;t get torn when Granny was climbing the fence. It got torn at school when three older girls who hate Elsa without Elsa really understanding why got hold of her outside the cafeteria and hit her and tore her scarf and threw it down the toilet. Their jeers are still echoing in Elsa&#x2019;s head. Granny notices the look in her eyes and leans forward before whispering in their secret language:<br> <br>&#x201c;One day we&#x2019;ll take those losers at your school to Miamas and throw them to the lions!&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsa dries her eyes with the back of her hand and smiles faintly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not stupid, Granny,&#x201d; she whispers. &#x201c;I know you did all that stuff t...</p><h2>Trick Is to Keep Breathing (Scottish Literature)</h2><p>This inventive first novel explores the widespread problem of female depression. A 27-year-old drama teacher named Joy Stone is losing her grip on the world. The problems of everyday living accumulate and begin to torture the narrator, who blames her problems not on her work or on the accidental death of her illict lover, but on herself. She reads horoscopes, plucks hairs, holds conversations inside and outside herself. A terrible memory tries to unfold but is resisted. Family and friends take on monstrous or pitiful guises; food threatens to become a major character. Clutching at the wrong things, the trick is to find those that let life go on. As things seen, things bought, and things said become obsessions, so the author conjures up the homely or horrifying world of litter in which the reader, like the heroine, lives.</p><p>Drama teacher Joy Stone is losing her grip.

Now Buckley returns to the strange land of Washington, D.C., in <b>Little Green Men</b>, a millennial comedy of manners about aliens and pundits . . . and how much they have in common. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The reluctant hero of this hilarious novel is John Oliver Banion, a stuffy Washington talk-show host, whose privileged life is thrown into upheaval when aliens abduct him from his exclusive country-club golf course.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But were his gray-skinned captors aliens . . . or something far more sinister? After Banion is abducted again--this time in Palm Springs--he believes he has been chosen by the extraterrestrials to champion the most important cause of the millennium, and he embarks on a crusade, appearing before a convention of UFO believers and demanding that Congress and the White House seriously investigate UFOs. His friends and family suspect that Banion is having some kind of manic-depressive midlife crisis and urge him to seek therapy before his credibility as a pillar of the punditocracy is ruined.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>So John Oliver Banion must choose: keep his establishment status or become the leader of millions of impassioned and somewhat scruffy new friends who want to expose the government's secret alien agenda.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Little Green Men</b> proves once and for all that the truth is out there. Way out there. And it reaffirms Christopher Buckley's status as the funniest humanoid writer in the universe.<br>Coming soon from Christopher Buckley:&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>One of Our Whales Is Missing</i></p><p>In Christopher Buckley's hilarious fourth novel, Washington, D.C., is naturally enough a place of sex, lies, and videotape. Unfortunately for <i>Little Green Men</i>'s pundit protagonist, John Oliver Banion, it is also the HQ of Majestic Twelve, a very, very covert government project. Since "that golden Cold War summer of 1947," MJ-12 has had a single mission--to convince taxpayers that space invaders are constantly lurking below what's left of the ozone layer. "A country convinced that little green men were hovering over the rooftops was inclined to vote yea for big weapons and space programs," the author thoughtfully explains.<p> But one disgruntled operative wants out. Nathan Scrubbs is fed up to the back teeth with the art of alien abduction--not to mention his cover as a Social Security flunky--so when his request for a transfer is quashed, he drunkenly decides to take it out on ubiquitous ultra-prig Banion, who happens to be on TV at the time. The ensuing high-tech kidnap, at Maryland's Burning Bush Country Club, is only one of the thousands of convulsively funny scenes in <i>Little Green Men</i>. Not that the novel isn't a skewed morality play of some sort: as Banion comes to believe in Tall Nordics and Short Ugly Grays, he is quickly removed from every A-list in town. But oddly enough, social and political disaster turns out to be as liberating as the finest alien probe. Let's just say that long before Banion and Scrubbs have a close encounter at the Millennium Man March on Washington, this Beltway barrel of monkeys attains a truly extraplanetary level of amusement. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"Little Green Men is a delicious, ingenious treat.

These glands combine to produce basal tears that flow into the nasolacrimal duct, which in turn empties into the nose. Under the right conditions of irritation, emotion, or illness, the glands yield more liquid than the nasolacrimal duct can handle, causing tears to spill out and drain over the eyelids. Thus crying, a rare human universal that we share with no other creature, for which reason Charles Darwin called it "a special expression of man."<p> There you have the basic science behind crying, a branch of inquiry that in literary scholar Tom Lutz's view ought to but does not bear the name "lacrimology" or even "lamentology." Lutz considers the natural history of weeping, writing vigorously and accessibly about the mysterious workings of the human body. But more, he looks into the cultural rules that surround crying, especially those in Western societies that only in the last few decades have established norms whereby women are supposed to cry freely in times of stress and trouble, whereas men are not. Illustrating his cultural history with examples from literature and art, Lutz delivers a fine, eminently readable exercise in popular anthropology, one that will be of wide interest. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Tom Lutz lives in Los Angeles and Iowa City, where he teaches at the University of Iowa.

Reprint.</p><p>Larry Millett is a columnist for the <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i>.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous sleuthing pair continues to inspire other mystery writers, as witnessed by these three titles. In Millett's novel, Sherlock Holmes, languishing between cases in London, seizes the opportunity to authenticateAfor the Swedish kingAa rune stone found in Minnesota. He and Watson (the narrator, of course) encounter a wide variety of locals, from a wealthy empire builder and a lusty saloon-keeper to a beautiful ex-brothel owner. Before they can examine the stone, however, someone steals it and kills its owner. Secretive, surprising, inventive, and ill-acquainted with modesty, Sherlock and his latest American adventure (e.g., Sherlock Holmes and the Ice Palace Murders) merit wide readership. Mycroft Holmes (Sherlock's older brother) and confidential secretary Peter Guthrie take the place of Holmes and Watson in Fawcett's series (Against the Brotherhood) "authorized" by Dame Jean Conan Doyle. Oddly enough, this pair's mission also involves the Swedish king, whom they must smuggle out of the country aboard a fast train to Scotland. Assassination attempts, murder, conspiracy, and secrecy all lend to the intrigue and tension. Literate prose and an overabundance of detail may dry this out for some, but purchase for fans. More Holmes for the Holidays, a follow-up to the 1996 Holmes for the Holidays, features 11 new tributes to Conan Doyle. Authors include not only well-known mystery writers such as Anne Perry, Jon Breen, and Peter Lovesey but also "cross-over" Western and sf writers, such as Bill Crider, Loren Estleman, and Tanith Lee. In Perry's story, which leads off, Holmes and Watson determine how a priceless Stradivarius was stolen from a locked room during a ten-minute time frame. In Lee's story, the pair confront an apparent puzzle dealing with a beautiful woman and a family curse. All in all, a likely purchase for most short story collections. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ultimate Book of Cross-sections</h2><p>An informative text is coupled with meticulously detailed, full-color, cross-sectional illustrations of bulldozers, planes, ships, cars, rockets, and more in order to provide answers to the many questions children have about the way things operate.</p><p>Gr. 6 and up.

Bowen Series, 45)</h2><p><p>In this landmark book, Scott Page redefines the way we understand ourselves in relation to one another. <i>The Difference</i> is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities.</p><br><p><i>The Difference</i> reveals that progress and innovation may depend less on lone thinkers with enormous IQs than on diverse people working together and capitalizing on their individuality. Page shows how groups that display a range of perspectives outperform groups of like-minded experts. Diversity yields superior outcomes, and Page proves it using his own cutting-edge research. Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, he explains why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you're talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory. He examines practical ways to apply diversity's logic to a host of problems, and along the way offers fascinating and surprising examples, from the redesign of the Chicago "El" to the truth about where we store our ketchup.</p><br><p>Page changes the way we understand diversity--how to harness its untapped potential, how to understand and avoid its traps, and how we can leverage our differences for the benefit of all.</p></p><p><p>"Scott Page has brought to our attention a practically important proposition: diversity of viewpoints is of the greatest importance in solving the problems that face us individually and collectively. Diversity among a group of problem solvers is more important than individual excellence. Page's exposition remarkably combines lightness and breadth of knowledge with rigor and evidence."<b>--Kenneth J. Arrow, Nobel Prize-winning economist</b></p><p>"Scott Page knows more about diversity than anyone anywhere. In <i>The Difference</i>, he shows why diversity matters, how it leads to better outcomes, and most importantly why achieving the significant benefits of diversity requires thinking well beyond traditional categories such as race, gender, or ethnicity. Knowledge of this book should be a litmus test for educators and diversity trainers--if you haven't read it, you are just talking metaphor. Stop playing defense and start playing offense by buying this book."<b>--Bill Miller, Chairman and Chief Investment Officer, Legg Mason Capital Management</b></p><p>"Does diversity trump ability when it comes to problem solving? Scott Page shows that the answer is, at least sometimes, yes. You'd do better to add more diversity of perspectives to your problem-solving team than to increase the average ability of individual team members. Diversity in both experience and identity can spark a group's creativity. Page pursues the logic of diversity and shows why and when hiring people who differ can lead to a better bottom line."<b>--Ian Ayres, coauthor of<i>Why Not? How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to Solve Problems Big and Small</i></b></p><p>"The book is brilliant. Page has a dazzling eclecticism."<b>--Max Bazerman, Harvard Business School</b></p><b>Scott E.

Tour.</p><p>This fictional story based on a young African American boy in New York City is grounded in history (co-writer Christopher Moore is the Commissioner of New York City Landmarks) and decorated with the whimsy of imagination and magic. When Terrence was seven years old, he was forced to spend Saturdays riding alongside his grandfather, a Metro bus driver, through the streets of the city. At first Terrence is resentful, but then he begins to listen to his grandfather's stories--the stories of the settling of New York, how the city belongs to all people of all races. Driving down St. Nicholas Avenue, his grandfather begins the story of "Santa &amp; Pete." He tells how St. Nicholas was imprisoned as a spy during the Inquisition, but was eventually rescued by Pete, a former slave in Spain under the Moors. The duo found their way to New York and began the long-standing tradition of giving gifts to the needy. When Terrence eventually discovers his connection to Pete, the story suggests that all who celebrate Christmas can be the rescuers and helpers of St. Nicholas. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>Christopher Moore</b> is the bestselling author of <i>You Suck</i>, <i>A Dirty Job</i>, <i>The Stupidest Angel</i>, <i>Fluke</i>, <i>Lamb</i>, <i>The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove</i>, <i>Island of the Sequined Love Nun</i>, <i>Bloodsucking Fiends</i>, and <i>Practical Demonkeeping</i>.

And I&#x2019;m sorry about the last-minute notification, but none of us saw this coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek was an astronomer, a physicist, a mathematician, and a WSA consultant. The latter gave him a few benefits, like the Van Entel, which he enjoyed passing on to his students. He was also a frequent guest speaker at scientific conferences. When he got in front of a microphone and looked out across an audience, he almost changed character. No one would ever have called him reserved, but he was not inclined to take over a conversation. On stage, however, he held his listeners&#x2019; attention, provoked laughter, and enjoyed himself immensely.<br> <br>Of the students, Karen Blum had probably the most potential. She showed serious analytical capabilities, she was ambitious, and she had an IQ that topped 160. She followed him out of the room. &#x201c;Professor Blanchard,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;may I ask what project you&#x2019;ll be working on? With the Van Entel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a specific project, Karen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You might think of me more as an eavesdropper. They&#x2019;ll be looking out at the Kellerman Cluster today. At some stars nobody&#x2019;s ever paid much attention to. They&#x2019;re trying to get them cataloged.&#x201d;<br> <br>Karen literally hugged herself. &#x201c;How far are they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven thousand light-years. Give or take.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beautiful. Is there anything special about them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really. Actually, they&#x2019;re not so much interested in the stars as they are in the telescope. It&#x2019;s still in its testing phase.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be using the Hynds as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The ultra-radiotelescope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. It&#x2019;s in orbit too, and it&#x2019;s also aimed at the area. We&#x2019;d like to see what else we can learn about what&#x2019;s going on out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes brightened. &#x201c;You planning on taking a trip to the area anytime soon?&#x201d;<br> <br>That was a reference to Derek&#x2019;s background, which consisted of several interstellar missions. That was one of the reasons he retained his situation with the World Space Authority while simultaneously teaching at Penn. &#x201c;Maybe next week,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a joke, right? They&#x2019;re closing down the interstellar flights, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If we let them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think the Centauri Initiative will really pass?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Karen&#x2019;s amicable expression turned hostile. &#x201c;Why do those idiots worry so much about alien invasions? There probably aren&#x2019;t any aliens who would be interested in bothering us. There are hardly any aliens at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>He managed a pained smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an election year.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The Data Collection Center was almost filled when he arrived twenty minutes early. Linda DuBreuil, the director, was standing guard by the group of seats reserved for the faculty. They were in front of the main screen. An additional eighty chairs were there to accommodate students and a few instructors not connected with the astronomy department. They were filling up as he walked in. The event had gotten coverage in the media, and he expected it to be picked up by the Science Channel.<br> <br>Linda saw him and got out of her chair. &#x201c;Hello, Derek. You ready to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes.&#x201d; He loved each new development in telescopes. Loved being part of the process, even when he was merely serving as a PR guy.<br> <br>They sat down and she handed him a microphone and an ear pod. &#x201c;You want to do the intro?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you like.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda had a smile that could light up the entire room. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your party, Derek.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good enough.&#x201d; He put the pod in his right ear so he could hear Ben, the AI, and turned the microphone on. &#x201c;Ben, you there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, Professor. We&#x2019;re on schedule.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda looked to their right, where a couple of people he didn&#x2019;t know were getting seated with the science faculty. &#x201c;We have some media,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The center filled and they had to bring in extra chairs, and finally just leave the doors open for any who wanted to stand in the rear. At five after eleven Derek got to his feet, turned to face the audience, and made some introductory comments about the Kellerman Cluster and the capabilities of the Van Entel. He was almost finished when Ben cut in. &#x201c;Professor, we&#x2019;ve received another alert from the Coordination Office.&#x201d; The Coordination Office was located on the Union Space Station. &#x201c;Control system will be transferred to us in one minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, we&#x2019;re apparently ready to go.&#x201d; Derek lowered his voice. &#x201c;Okay, Ben. Activate the display.&#x201d; The screen lit up, as did a couple of smaller displays around the room. Derek looked out over his audience. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be handling the operation from here. You&#x2019;ll notice, incidentally, when we tell the control system what to do, there&#x2019;ll be a delay before it responds. You know why that is, of course?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hands went up all over the room. Everybody knew the Van Entel was approximately five million kilometers away, so the radio signal would need about eighteen seconds to reach it. And consequently thirty-six seconds before there could be a response.<br> <br>One of his students, Bobby Dexter, raised his hand. &#x201c;Really? Only half a minute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty close right now, Bobby. Sometimes the process would take close to a half hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>The screen filled with stars, two the size of small coins, the others no more than distant glimmers in the night. &#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; Derek said, &#x201c;you know the target system. Take us to it, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Transmission on its way. Hynds also activated.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek did a mental countdown. He reached nineteen before the stars began to move. From right to left, across the screen. The two coins slipped off the side of the screen. People were shifting in their seats behind him. He&#x2019;d gotten so excited, he&#x2019;d lost track of the fact he was still on his feet, blocking everyone&#x2019;s view. He didn&#x2019;t want to sit down, so he moved to the side of the room where he was out of the way.<br> <br>Derek loved this part of his profession, inflaming the passions of students. There might be another Polcrest or Sagan in the room. Somebody who&#x2019;d lead the charge against the politicians who were trying to wreck everything humans had accomplished in space over the past three centuries. We&#x2019;ve been down this road before, damn it. Went to the moon and forgot how to do it. And here we go again with people, including scientists, claiming that interstellar travel is too dangerous. That it should be stopped. We don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s out there. And it has gone to the heart of the current presidential campaign. We&#x2019;ve looked around the local area. But stop it there. Do not go west of Centauri. It had become a maxim for the Progressives.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;d been present for a demonstration of the capabilities of a supertelescope, but having his hand on the wheel added a dimension he hadn&#x2019;t experienced in the past. He watched the stars drift by, saw a configuration that might have been a wrench, and knew where they were. More or less. The wrench reached the side and was gone, and he was lost again. But no surprises there.<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor Blanchard,&#x201d; said the AI, &#x201c;Union advises we slow down so they can get the two telescopes in sync.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do it, Ben. And let&#x2019;s also increase magnification.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sky was still moving sidewise when a vast cloud of stars began to edge in on the right side. Students gasped. Somebody asked whether anyone living out there would ever see night. Derek was ecstatic.<br> <br>A young man seated a few rows back jumped out of his seat and started jabbing his finger at the display. A planet had appeared in the foreground.<br> <br>It was, Derek thought, a rogue world. But it was hard to be certain, and before he could get a good look, it had gone off the edge of the screen. The infamous thirty-six-second delay. Still more stars were going off the side. Damn. Well, forget the planet. They had bigger things to think about.<br> <br>He wanted the cluster in the center of the display, but it was already almost halfway across the screen before he stopped gaping and gave the order to stop the rotation.<br> <br>It continued to drift while he waited. Finally it stopped and they had a near-perfect perspective. It was spectacular. As breathtaking as anything he&#x2019;d ever seen. He would have liked to inform everyone what they were looking at. But he didn&#x2019;t know anything more about the specifics of the cluster than his students. That was an issue with the giant telescopes: He could spend a substantial amount of time tracing star patterns, constellations, whatever, but when the telescope zeroed in, the patterns tended to disappear. He was simply, like everyone else, staring at a sky full of stars. And if he did recognize a group of stars, it became rapidly irrelevant because there was just too much to look at. Pity. It would have been nice to be able to show off a bit.<br> <br>Ben&#x2019;s voice again: &#x201c;Derek, we are getting a signal from the Hynds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve picked up something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. It appears to be a telecast. From the edge of the cluster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A telecast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is correct. Do you wish it placed on the display?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek had no idea what he expected. It would have to be a directional signal to make it this far. No standard telecast could come close to covering thousands of light-years. So it was probably what? A distress call? A mission report?<br> <br>Ben reduced the telescopic image to about a quarter of its size and moved it into a corner. Then he replaced it with a waterfall. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is the telecast.&#x201d;<br> <br>A waterfall?<br> <br>The audience froze and then broke into applause. Several wanted to know whether the system had gone off track somewhere. Linda reached over and grasped Derek&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s not Niagara.&#x201d;<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t an expansive waterfall, but it appeared to be extremely high, with water plummeting from a ridge deep into a canyon. He was just beginning to breathe normally again when he became aware of background music. It was a soft and gentle rhythm, in perfect harmony with the falling water.<br> <br>The applause faded and the room went silent, save for the music. Then suddenly everybody was talking. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor Blanchard, what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda was looking at him and just shaking her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is that the signal that&#x2019;s coming in?&#x201d; He adjusted the microphone so everyone could hear the answer. &#x201c;Or have we picked up something local?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was forwarded by the Hynds unit. I have no way to determine its validity beyond that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It must be a transmission problem,&#x201d; said Karl Michaels, the science department chairman.<br> <br>He had to be right. The system had gotten screwed up. &#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; said Derek, as the noise level began to rise again, &#x201c;connect me with the Coordination unit.&#x201d;<br> <br>People in the audience were getting out of their chairs. &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be real.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s it coming from?&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman behind him seized his shoulder. &#x201c;Professor Blanchard, are we really seeing that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Michaels was on his feet, staring at the waterfall. &#x201c;Derek, any chance this is really happening?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything&#x2019;s possible, Karl.&#x201d;<br> <br>A male voice came in over the circuit. &#x201c;This is Coordination. You guys have a problem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you seen what&#x2019;s coming in through the Hynds?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; He broke off. &#x201c;My God, that can&#x2019;t be right. Hold on.&#x201d; He broke away and Derek heard him talking in the background.<br> <br>The music played on. Derek&#x2019;s feet pressed against the floor in a subconscious effort to stop it.<br> <br>A woman&#x2019;s voice broke in. &#x201c;Give us a minute. We&#x2019;re checking on it now.&#x201d; Then she was talking to someone else: &#x201c;You have any idea where they are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek couldn&#x2019;t make out the response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor Blanchard. I can&#x2019;t explain this. We&#x2019;re not showing any technical issues.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Could you check it out? If you find anything, get back to me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. The techs are looking at it now.&#x201d;<br> <br>He signed off. &#x201c;Ben, can you lock in on the star that&#x2019;s closest to the source of this?&#x201d; Water was still spilling serenely over the edge while the music continued. &#x201c;Get me a catalog number.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For the star?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Working on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek covered the microphone and tried to laugh everything off with his audience. &#x201c;One of the reasons astronomy is such a pleasure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You just never know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Ben was back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s KL37741.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What can you tell me about it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a class G yellow dwarf. Range is approximately 7,300 light-years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can give you spectroscopic details if you want. But nothing about them stands out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we get some additional magnification, Ben?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Negative. We are at maximum now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does it have a planet within the Goldilocks Zone?&#x201d; In the area that would allow liquid water to exist.<br> <br>He needed several minutes to respond to that. Finally, he was back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too far to determine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda was staring at the display. She looked gloriously happy. &#x201c;Aliens?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Derek, did we just discover aliens? Who play music?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The reporters were waving, trying to get their attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need a planet,&#x201d; said Linda. &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s out there. That&#x2019;s all that matters. But we need a name for the star. This is going to be fairly big news, and we can&#x2019;t just run around, referring to it by a bunch of digits.&#x201d;<br> &lt;...</p><h2>Just Scarves: Favorite Patterns to Knit and Crochet</h2><p>A scarf is a great beginner project, but the wide variety of patterns in <i>Just Scarves</i> ensures that even the most seasoned crafter will create something new and exciting.

Intent on exploring and explaining every aspect of anatomy and physiology, he performed over thirty dissections of human cadavers and many more of animals. He is also among the greatest draftsmen ever to have lived, and his studies of skeletons, musculature, and other visible structures remain to this day largely unsurpassed in their lucidity.In addition to his anatomical drawings, Leonardo meticulously recorded his many findings on the pages of his notebooks with the hope of one day publishing a treatise on anatomy. Among the more than one thousand pages of these notebooks were a number of important discoveries that, had they been published, would have transformed Western understanding of biological sciences. But despite admiration by the likes of Benvenuto Cellini, Giorgio Vasari, and Albrecht D�rer who made a number of drawings from Leonardo&#x2019;s anatomical studies the work was never c</p><p><p><b>Martin Clayton</b> is curator of the print room at Windsor Castle. <b>Ron Philo</b> is adjunct associate professor in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.</p><p> &nbsp;</p>The name Leonardo da Vinci likely conjures images of the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or <i>The Last Supper</i>, but one of his greatest legacies are his anatomical drawings, which were astoundingly accurate for his time. . . .

But suppose if an American girl were born with abilities in chess that matched the greatest players. What would happen to her in a highly competitive field dominated by men?</p> <p>Starting from this premise, the author Walter Tevis, who some years ago interested a generation of Americans in straight pool with the book &#x201c;The Hustler&#x201d;, has produced a riveting novel that makes chess more exciting than one could have imagined.</p> <p>Orphaned at eight when both of her parents are killed in a car accident, Beth is sent to the Methuen Home. A frightened little girl, she survives on the tranquilizers the home doles out to make the children &#x201c;easier to handle&#x201d;. She is sent to the basement to get chalkboard erasers and she finds players sitting with a checkerboard with strange little pieces on it. She is strangely fascinated and she keeps coming back to the basement to watch. She has learned the moves by herself and keeps coming to watch by a desire she hardly understands. She overcomes her shyness and a janitor teaches her the moves. From that moment on, although she does not at once realize it, her whole life has forever changed.</p> <p>Eight year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appearances unremarkable. That is until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer, and for the first time in her life she feels herself fully in control. By the age of sixteen, she's competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as she hones her skills on the professional circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape becomes all the more tempting. Engaging and fast-paced, The Queen's Gambit speeds to a conclusion as elegant and satisfying as a mate in four.</p></p><p>" The Queen's Gambit is sheer entertainment.

During World War Two, Juliet was conscripted into service, transcribing conversations between an MI5 agent and a ring of suspected German sympathizers. The seemingly dull work quickly plunged Juliet into a treacherous world of code words and secret meetings where Juliet herself was sent into the field. These moments of intrigue and romance feel like a lifetime ago as Juliet trudges through her commute, her job and her new life. But as Juliet and the rest of London find ways to return to normal, her routine is upended by an encounter with a mysterious man from her past life.<br><br>Haunted by the relationships and actions of her past and facing a very real threat in the present, Juliet cannot escape the repercussions of her work for the government. With no other choice, Juliet is quickly pulled back into the life of espionage she thought she'd left behind. Kate Atkinson's latest novel brings mid-century London to life in a gripping tale of deception and consequences.</p><p>KATE ATKINSON won the Whitbread (now Costa) Book of the Year prize with her first novel, <i>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</i>. Her four bestselling novels featuring former detective Jackson Brodie became the BBC television series <i>Case Histories</i>, starring Jason Isaacs. The international sensation <i>Life After Life</i> was one of <i>The New York Times</i>'s 10 Best Books of 2013, won the Costa Novel Award and the South Bank Sky Arts Literature Prize, and was shortlisted for the Women's Prize. Her companion novel, <i>A God in Ruins</i>, also won the Costa Novel Award and was an international bestseller.

Hilary Mantel once said of Atkinson's ground-breaking first novel,<i> Behind the Scenes at the Museum</i>, that she had a 'game-plan more sophisticated than Dickens,' and that skill is more than evident in this latest offering. . . . Remarkable. . . . The sheer bravura of Atkinson's storytelling is such that you will find it impossible not to want to revisit those clues so cleverly placed, as you shake your head in disbelief at how effortlessly you have been taken in." &#x2014;<i>The Times Literary Supplement </i>(<i>TLS</i>)<br> &nbsp;<br>"[<i>Transcription</i>] never loses its sense of absurdity of human beings even in their most tragic or noble moments. . . . How vehemently most novelists will wish to produce a masterpiece as good." &#x2014;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Daily Telegraph </i>(UK)<br> &nbsp;<br>"[<i>Transcription</i>] is a major event. . . . Atkinson loves her research, but she doesn't need much help concocting original stories that resemble no one else's and take the breath away." &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Atkinson's writing is, as always, heaven to read. . . . It's mesmerizing, from every angle." &#x2014;<i>The Seattle Times<br></i><br>"Atkinson has predicated her enormously successful career upon giving readers intelligent and artful iterations of what they already know they like: made-up Johns and Janes, in realistically described settings, enacting a plot that's not only ingeniously constructed but, in the end, fully resolved. . . . Yet Atkinson's exceptional reader-friendliness has always been a Trojan horse, a way of delivering something pointed in the guise of something smoothly familiar. She occupies that rare cultural sweet spot wherein she scoops up awards for artistic excellence while also reliably hitting the bestseller lists. . . . There is no question that a large part of what makes Atkinson's work so cleverly, stealthily affecting is its sheep's clothing." &#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"A triumph." &#x2014;<i>Good Housekeeping</i><br><br>"Atkinson is brilliant. Her characters are brilliant. Her command of the back-and-forth narrative, the un-fixedness of memory, the weight that guilt accrues over time and how we carry it is remarkable. . . .&nbsp;Everything Atkinson does subverts the classic model of the spy story. . . . It's that grunginess, that groundedness, that attention to the tiny, personal, low-stakes details . . . that elevates <i>Transcription</i>." &#x2014;NPR<br><br>"No other contemporary novelist has such supreme mastery of that sweet spot between high and low, literary and compulsively readable as Kate Atkinson. . . .&nbsp;I can't think of another serious novelist who makes you laugh so often or so gratefully. . . . Brimming with dancing dark wit that reminds you how deeply satisfying good fiction can be." &#x2014;Allison Pearson, <i>The Daily&nbsp;Telegraph </i>(UK)<br><br>"Atkinson dissolves the choices that bedevil us: between big plots and wry, acute, noticing sentences; between genre and literary fiction; between the wildly popular and the wildly nuanced." &#x2014;<i>USA Today<br></i><br>"Ambitious and cerebral." &#x2014;<i>Toronto Star</i><br><br>"Atkinson creates a contemporary version of a ripping good yarn. . . . Her trick is to combine propulsive plot with a high degree of self-consciousness, and in&nbsp;<i>Transcription</i>&nbsp;the fiction comes with a skin so thin it is almost transparent. What she reveals of its inner working is a novel full of smoke and mirrors, of artifice and redirection in which all that is solid melts into air." &#x2014;<i>The Spectator</i><br><br>"Atkinson's wry style imbues the world of <i>Transcription</i> with moments of brisk cheer, as if Ian Fleming had been cross-pollinated with Barbara Pym. . . . [<i>Transcription</i> is]&nbsp;a testament to Atkinson's inventiveness as a storyteller, as well as to her powers for creating characters too real for comfort." &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post<br></i><br>"No matter the genre, Atkinson displays more wit and word play, more delight in the fecundity of the English language, than just about any contemporary novelist. . . . No matter how distractingly thrilling her plots are, we always sense a keen, and essentially verbal, intelligence behind them." &#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"<i>Transcription</i>, while sometimes fraught and tense, is more often shrewdly funny. . . . Atkinson runs around her spy novel, seeking out the genre's inflated pockets of self-importance and poking them with her sharp little needle." &#x2014;<i>Slate<br></i><br>"<i>Transcription</i> stands alongside its immediate predecessors as a fine example of Kate Atkinson's mature work, an unapologetic novel of ideas which is also wise, funny and paced like a thriller." &#x2014;<i>The Observer </i>(UK)<br><br> "Atkinson never fails to take us beyond an individual's circumstances to the achingly human, often-contradictory impulses within. And, as all of Atkinson's readers know, she is an exquisite writer of prose, using language with startling precision whether she is plumbing an inner life, describing events of appalling violence or displaying her characters' wonderfully acerbic wit. . . .&nbsp;This is a wonderful novel about making choices, failing to make them and living, with some degree of grace, the lives our choices determine for us." &#x2015;<i><i>Booklist</i></i>, starred review<br><br>"There is intrigue. There are surprises. But the unknowns aren't always what we think they are. The deepest pleasure here, though, is the author's language. As ever, Atkinson is sharp, precise and funny." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review<br><br>"If you're still obsessed with Kate Atkinson's&nbsp;<i>Life After Life</i>, you're going to fall head over heels for&nbsp;<i>Transcription.</i>"&nbsp;&#x2015;<i>POPSUGAR<br></i><br>"This is a novel about identity in which no one and nothing is exactly as they seem. . . . Atkinson is clearly having fun. . . . What elevates her fiction above mere playfulness is the emotional integrity of her characters. . . . Atkinson always puts on a damn fine show." &#x2014;<i>The Guardian&nbsp;</i>(UK)<br><br>"A new Kate Atkinson novel is always a reason to rejoice and&nbsp;<i>Transcription</i>&nbsp;was everything I was hoping for and more. . . .

I immediately wanted to read it all over again." &#x2014;<i>Red</i><br><br>"Kate Atkinson's splendid <i>Transcription</i> is a thrilling read. . . . [It is] a gripping spy story with a narrative so ingeniously, so perfectly constructed that as soon as I finished the book I wanted to read it again, just to marvel at how beautifully everything slots together. . . . <i>Transcription</i> is the sort of book that reminds you how profound and satisfying and moving and exhilarating good fiction can be. It's the best novel I've read all year. I can't praise it enough." &#x2014;<i>The Irish Times</i><br><br>"A treat&#x2014;cerebral and suspenseful, playful and empathetic."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Mail on Sunday </i>(UK)<br> &nbsp;<br>"Full of intrigue. . . . Sublimely suspenseful&#x2014;droll, devious and deadly, beautifully serious."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Sunday Express </i>(UK)<br><br>"In <i>Transcription</i>, Kate Atkinson recasts the bildungsroman within the fertile genre of the spy thriller. . . . Kate Atkinson has always enjoyed playing with genre. . . . As the plot of this accomplished novel hurtles towards its astonishing denouement, even the canniest reader may feel wrong-footed." &#x2014;<i>Literary Review</i><br><br>"[<i>Transcription</i>] is already being touted as [Atkinson's] most assured and affecting [novel] yet. Atkinson often plays hard and fast with structure, and fans will be heartened to know that this book is no exception, culminating in a fantastically shocking, clever ending. . . . <i>Transcription's</i> bait-and-switch ending&#x2014;and it would be a shame to reveal too much of it here&#x2014;proves that in terms of finesse and assuredness, Atkinson as a writer is moving on and up inexorably. In the purple patch where marketability and literary flair meet, Atkinson finds herself in the finest of company." &#x2014;<i>Irish Independent</i><br><br>"There are plenty of twists and turns in this terrific page-turner, some shocking moments and a narrator whom the author encourages us to love. . . . But writing a novel is like a form of deep cover, and perhaps Atkinson is like the spy in this one, whose handler says admiringly 'the mark of a good agent is when you have no idea which side they're on.' You'll be kept guessing until the end."&nbsp;&#x2015;<i>Evening Standard </i>(UK)<i><br></i><br>"Atkinson handles her mazy, Le Carre-style plot with complete authority. But there's a lot more to the novel than its page-turning thrills. The increasingly skeptical Juliet makes for a very appealing heroine and the darker material is interspersed with some neat comedy. Above all, Atkinson recreates the atmosphere of both wartime and post-war London with utter conviction."&nbsp;&#x2015;<i>Reader's Digest&nbsp;</i>(UK)<br><br>"Kate Atkinson's fluid identity as a novelist has long marked her out as one of Britain's most interesting&#x2014;and often underrated&#x2014;writers. . . . Atkinson's depiction of espionage and counter-espionage on the Home Front is nimble and convincing. . . . But there is an immensely serious book here too, waiting in the wings to reveal itself on the very last pages; a book that asks us to question the entertainment we&#x2019;ve just gobbled up, and to reckon with what lies beneath it.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>New Statesman</i><br><br>"Kate Atkinson is a masterful manipulator of lies. <i>Transcription</i> is a spectacular game of deception, her own perfect plot. It is as twisty and efficient&#x2014;everything falls into place like the tumblers of a combination lock&#x2014;as the best of Le Carr�." &#x2014;<i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i><br><br>"In Atkinson's deliberate and manipulative hands, spy stories are simply regular fiction on steroids." &#x2014;<i>Maclean's<br></i><br>"The reader watches the slow, intimate unravelling of Juliet 'like a ball of wool' as she veers from na�ve and romantic to violent and despairing. This, combined with the clipped tones, casual sexism and dry war humour, lend the book authenticity and sharp poignancy. . . . It is the questions left unanswered&#x2014;what is the worth of war? Does self-doubt lie at the root of destruction?&#x2014;that make the book so addictive." &#x2014;<i>The Economist</i><br><br>"Kate Atkinson is a wonderful writer. I want to write like her when I grow up. <i>Transcription</i> shows she's at the peak of her powers. Full of beautiful, delicate, sharp sentences and characterizations. A spy novel that dismantles the whole genre. A class act, as ever." &#x2015;Matt Haig, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Reasons to Stay Alive </i>and <i>How to Stop Time<br><br></i>"I loved Kate Atkinson's <i>Transcription&#x2015;</i>you don't know if it's a farce about spies, or a spy story about farce."&nbsp;&#x2015;Hanya Yanagihara, author of <i>A Little Life<br><br></i>"Atkinson writes with wit and verve, bringing London in 1940 to vibrant life."&nbsp;&#x2014;Stephen King</p><h2>Swords of Dragonfire: The Knights of Myth Drannor, Book II (Forgotten Realms Novel: Knights of Myth Drannor): Bk. 2</h2><p>In the sequel to Swords of Eveningstar, Florin and his companions have finally made a name for themselves, only to discover that they have become pawns in the battle for power between the forces of dark and light and are forced to unravel the deception and betrayal that surround them before it is too late. 23,000 first printing.</p><p>ED GREENWOOD, creator of the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> setting, is the best-selling author of hundreds of novels, game products, and articles in the setting.

It was no more than three feet away and he could see it with absolute clarity in the light that was coming from behind him. He contemplated the ice through the mist of his breath, noticing the lines that ran around its edge like tree rings. He understood they were formed when the tide lapped its underside, adding a little to the surface, then receded, leaving it hanging over the mud. He was groggy, but his powers of reason were working. That was good. </p><p> Harland moved his head a little and listened. There was a ringing inside his ears but he could hear the slap of the water and the agitated clicking of dead reeds somewhere off to his left. Beyond these there was a commotion -- sirens and the noise of a helicopter. </p><p> The light didn't allow him to see how he was trapped, but he felt something heavy pinning him down from behind and he knew that his legs were bent backward because the muscles in his groin and on the tops of his thighs were burning with pain. The rest of him was numb. He reckoned he must have been there for some time. </p><p> He pulled at his arms, which had been plunged vertically into the mud. The movement caused his face to fall forward nearer the mud and his nostrils to fill with the smell of the sea. The tide! He could see that the water had risen a little in the time since he had become conscious. The tide would come in and cover his face. He had to get free -- shift the weight that was holding him down. But he felt weak and dazed and there was nothing for him to push against to hold his face away from the mud. He groped behind him and felt the seat. Jesus, he was still strapped into his seat! He ran his right hand up and down searching for the seat belt and found it stretched tight across the top of his chest. That explained the pain in the area of his heart. Eventually he located the buckle, flipped its tongue with his thumb, and sagged forward into the mud. </p><p> It was going to be okay. He'd be able to shift the seat, or wriggle from underneath it. A little more purchase was all that was needed. But that wasn't going to be easy. Exerting the slightest pressure made him sink closer to the water. He knew that the mud had absorbed the force of his impact and had saved his life, but now he cursed it. </p><p> He began to prod and grope beneath the mud. After several minutes he touched something solid, an old plank of wood. It was slippery, but it did not move when he gripped it with both hands and then pushed upward with all his strength, bringing his legs awkwardly into play. Nothing happened. He slumped down again and inhaled the mud's odor of decay. He had to concentrate on controlling his breath, which was coming in shallow puffs. </p><p> As he waited, the breeze peppered his face with grains of ice and he realized for the first time how cold it was. He breathed deeply, right into his stomach, and tightened his grip beneath the mud. He was going to do it. He was going to lift the damned seat because he hadn't survived the crash to be drowned in six inches of the East River. </p><p> He pushed again and this time felt the right side of the seat lift slightly. He threw his bottom up and with a desperate writhing motion managed to free first one leg, then the other, and roll over into the sea water. The cold made him gasp. He lunged upward, knocking the lip of ice, which broke off with a chink, dug his fingers into the bank, and pulled himself to a kneeling position. The mud sucked at his shins. He saw the seat now and a tangle of metal and torn plastic attached to the back of it. He looked up and across to Manhattan, ranged along the skyline like a miniature tiara. He realized that he was seeing it through a gauze of tiny ice particles floating on the breeze. But there was something else -- the insides of his eyelids seemed to be imprinted with a golden light that flared every time he blinked. And there was a new sensation in his head, halfway between pain and sound. </p><p> Shielding his face from the wind, Harland turned and peered toward La Guardia. It was difficult to make out exactly what was happening against the background of the airport's lights. There appeared to be two fires that were being fed by plumes of foam from the emergency vehicles. The nearest was a few hundred yards away. The lights shot across a long, horizontal shadow, which Harland took to be some form of dike, to play across the mudflats and skim the sea. He wondered how the wreckage of the UN plane had ended up so far from him. Maybe it had kept traveling after breaking up; or perhaps there'd been a collision, which would explain why he could see two fires. But that didn't match his memory of the moments as they approached the runway. He had felt no impact, just the shocking lurch to the right that came as he turned from trying to see the lights of Rikers Island to Alan Griswald's face. That was all he knew before a terrible force took hold of him and obliterated everything in his mind. </p><p> He climbed onto the bank, shook the worst of the mud from his legs, and rubbed his calves and thighs to get the circulation back. The bank, which he had taken for part of the shoreline, turned out to be a tiny island of a few square feet. Despite the frost, the ground crumbled easily, and when he moved, clods of soil and dead vegetation slipped into the water. He peered down into the darkness to see how far he would have to wade to get to the shore, his mind fumbling to make sense of his situation. He had to think about the depth of the water and the possibility of sinking into the mud and getting stuck. And he had to remember the tide because he wasn't in any state to swim, not even a short distance in the currents that he knew hurtled through the East River. There was also the ferocious cold. It was already way below freezing and the wind-chill was getting to him, sapping energy from his legs. He might die of exposure before they found him. </p><p> Where was the helicopter he'd heard? Why the hell weren't they looking? They must've worked out that the plane had broken up and there would be casualties out here in the tide. But the runway was raised quite a height above the mudflats and he knew that would mean they wouldn't spot anything by chance. They would have to be looking -- they would have to know people were out here. </p><p> He looked out over the water to see if any rescue boats had been launched. No lights, no sound -- nothing. He searched the dark around him and then as his eyes moved across the sea toward the Bronx he caught sight of something about forty feet away. It was a piece of wreckage -- another aircraft seat, he was sure. A little closer to him was an oblong object bobbing in the water -- perhaps a door. A cry rose up in him and he bellowed. "Over here, help! Over here." </p><p> He told himself not to be so damned stupid. No one could hear him above the wind. He cautioned himself to keep a tighter control of his fear. He must conserve his energy. </p><p> But then it struck him that someone might be out there and that the person could be trapped. He looked again and thought he saw a foot projecting from the end of the seat. Without thinking more about it, he lowered himself into the water and gingerly tested the depth. The mud shelved away to the right but ahead of him it appeared to be level, and although his feet sank into the mud with each step, it was just possible to wade. </p><p> He moved slowly out into the open, where the breeze was skimming foam from the tops of the waves. The headlights of a truck had maneuvered in the distance and sent a beam across the water to pick out part of the seat. He was about halfway there and he could see that the seat was tipped backward and was propped against a stack of tufted soil. Around him was a lot of other wreckage, knocking about in the waves. He grabbed a long plastic panel and felt the rest of the way. When he reached the seat he called out once then took a step sideways to see better and prodded it with the panel. The seat fell to the side and a body slumped into a patch of light. </p><p> He knew he was looking at Alan Griswald, although most of his face had gone and part of the neck and shoulder had been torn away. He must have been killed instantly. Poor bastard: one moment draining a tumbler of scotch, the next he was out here, mangled and ruptured and dead. </p><p> Harland felt dreadfully cold. A shudder welled up in his back and ran through his entire body. He had been stupid to get so wet because it reduced his options. Before he might have waited but now he was so cold he had no choice but to wade back past the little island and strike out toward the lights of the emergency vehicles and to what he hoped was the shore. At the same time he realized that his strength was going and -- more alarming -- he could feel the increased drag of the tide plucking at his legs. </p><p> He turned to go, then stopped and listened intently to a new noise. He cupped his hand to his ear. It was a muffled sound -- muffled but insistent -- and it was coming from Griswald's body. Suddenly he understood: it was a cell phone. Griswald had kept his phone switched on and now it was ringing. He waded through the water, ran his hands over the body, and felt the phone inside Griswald's breast pocket. He thrust his hand inside the dead man's jacket, steeling himself against the blood and pulp of his chest, and pulled out the phone and another object -- a wallet. He was about to throw it away when something told him it would be needed for identification. He slipped it into his hip pocket. </p><p> The phone was still ringing. He stabbed at the keypad and brought it to his cheek. </p><p> "Hello." </p><p> "Al?" came a woman's voice. She was a long way off and the wind was making it difficult to hear, but he thought he recognized the voice. </p><p> "Look," stumbled Harland. </p><p> "Who is this?" demanded the woman. </p><p> Harland grimaced to himself. "Look, Alan can't take your call." </p><p> "Who is this speaking? Where's Alan?" The panic in her voice was rising. "Why have you got my husband's phone?" </p><p> Harland saw nothing for it but to hang up. Sally Griswald would learn soon enough. He held the phone in front of him and dialed his own direct line at the UN building. </p><p> "Marika?" </p><p> "This is she." The voice was brisk -- troubled. </p><p> "Marika, I need you to listen very carefully." </p><p> "Oh, my God! Mr. Harland? You don't know what's happened. It's terrible. The plane's crashed at La Guardia. The flight from Washington. All those people. We just got the news a few minutes ago." </p><p> "I was on the flight." </p><p> "What are you saying? I can't hear you." </p><p> "I was on the flight. I'm okay. But I need you to tell them where </p><p> I am." </p><p> "I don't understand. It's not on your schedule -- " </p><p> "Listen, for God's sake, Marika." He was shouting and he knew he was terrifying the life out of her. "I was on the flight. And now I'm stranded in the East River. You've got to tell them where to find me." </p><p> "Oh, my God..." </p><p> "Tell them I'm in a direct line between the northeast runway and Rikers Island. The tide's coming in fast and I need them to get here quickly. Marika, now don't hang up! Keep the line open...Marika?" </p><p> Another voice came on the line. "Bobby, it's Nils Langstrom." </p><p> "Thank God," said Harland. Langstrom had a cool head. "I was on the flight that crashed. I'm stranded in the East River. I guess I'm about one hundred and fifty, maybe two hundred yards from the runway on a line with Rikers Island. I'm in the water and I'm going to try and get myself back on dry land. They'll see some wreckage from the plane. I'll wait there. But tell them they've got to move quickly. There may be other people out here." </p><p> "Got it. I'll make sure they understand where you are." </p><p> "I've got to hang up now and get to the island." </p><p> "Don't take any risks..." </p><p> Harland pressed the Off key and clamped the phone between his teeth. He ignored the taste of blood on the phone and looked up to get his bearings. It wasn't easy. Wading out to where Griswald lay had been fine because the light from behind him had shown him the way. Going back was a different matter. Beneath the distant beam from the truck everything was pitch black. He picked up the plastic panel, which he had kept wedged between his legs, and set off, jabbing at the water ahead of him. All around him was the excited rippling of a tide in full flood. </p><p> Part of him remained aloof from the situation, a dispassionate observer, registering the difficulty he had pulling his legs out of the mud, noticing the shortness of his breath, the lifelessness in his arms, the fatigue clouding the front of his brain and tempting his eyes to close. The cold was beyond anything he'd experienced. It was robbing him of his will, making his thoughts sloppy and his movements clumsy. </p><p> This part of Harland, the remote, calculating part, recognized that he had only a very short time. </p><p> It was beginning to snow. Big snowflakes were streaming across his vision, making a little vortex along the line of the headlight beam. He put his head down and worked his shoulders to take several quick strides. The water had reached halfway up his thighs when he put his left leg down, found nothing, and toppled sideways into the current. His lungs contracted with shock, expelling the air with a succession of hollow shouts, the first of which caused him to let go of the phone in his mouth. Then, as he flailed in the water like a child learning to swim, he lost his grip on the panel. He knew his only chance now was to make it back to the point where he could stand, but the current was very strong and his power to resist it had gone. His lungs wouldn't keep the air down and he was swallowing water. He tilted his head back and stretched out his arms, his brain grasping at half a memory of a training session he'd endured long ago in Poole Harbor. He was floating, allowing the current to take him and to twirl him around like a piece of flotsam. He was aware of looking up at the snow. The light seemed to be growing fainter and the snow was getting denser. His terror was being edged out by blankness and submission. One thought kept moving through him: this is it, I'm going to die; this is it, I'm going to die. </p><p> And then his foot hit something and the current spun him around so that his bottom grazed the mud. He had been washed up on another bank. He reached his hands out backward and clawed awkwardly at the mud, trying to get his head above the water. He found some roots just below the surface. With the last reserve of energy he turned and brought himself to all fours and choked the water out. He stayed there heaving and gulping in the terrible cold for what seemed like several minutes. Then he looked up and squinted through the sea water that was still stinging his eyes. There was no sign of anyone. They weren't looking for him. </p><p> He listened. A seabird called out in the dark and again he heard the rasp and click of reeds nearby. He had to think. He had to think, dammit. But his mind was moving so slowly. He'd crawl into the reeds where the mud would be firm because of the roots and he would drag himself to his feet and stand so that they would see him.

After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years. She currently lives in Atlanta with her husband and daughter. This is her first novel.Two days later, I sit in my parent's kitchen, waiting for dusk to fall. Igive in and light another cigarette even though last night the surgeongeneral came on the television set and shook his finger at everybody,trying to convince us that smoking will kill us. But Mother once toldme tongue kissing would turn me blind and I'm starting to think it'sall just a big plot between the surgeon general and Mother to make sureno one ever has any fun.<br><br>At eight o'clock that same night, I'mstumbling down Aibileen's street as discreetly as one can carrying afifty-pound Corona typewriter. I knock softly, already dying foranother cigarette to calm my nerves. Aibileen answers and I slipinside. She's wearing the same green dress and stiff black shoes aslast time.<br><br>I try to smile, like I'm confident it will workthis time, despite the idea she explained over the phone. "Could we...;sit in the kitchen this time?" I ask. "Would you mind?"<br><br>"Alright. Ain't nothing to look at, but come on back."<br><br>The kitchen is about half the size of the living room and warmer. It smellslike tea and lemons. The black-and-white linoleum floor has beenscrubbed thin. There's just enough counter for the china tea set. I setthe typewriter on a scratched red table under the window. Aibileenstarts to pour the hot water into the teapot.<br><br>"Oh, nonefor me, thanks," I say and reach in my bag. "I brought us some Co-Colasif you want one." I've tried to come up with ways to make Aibileen morecomfortable. Number One: Don't make Aibileen feel like she has to serveme.<br><br>"Well, ain't that nice. I usually don't take my tea tilllater anyway." She brings over an opener and two glasses. I drink minestraight from the bottle and seeing this, she pushes the glasses aside,does the same.<br><br>I called Aibileen after Elizabeth gave me thenote, and listened hopefully as Aibileen told me her idea for her towrite her own words down and then show me what she's written. I triedto act excited. But I know I'll have to rewrite everything she'swritten, wasting even more time. I thought it might make it easier ifshe could see it in type-face instead of me reading it and telling herit can't work this way.<br><br>We smile at each other. I take a sip of my Coke, smooth my blouse. "So...;" I say.<br><br>Aibileen has a wire-ringed notebook in front of her. "Want me to...;just go head and read?"<br><br>"Sure," I say.<br><br>We both take deep breaths and she begins reading in a slow, steady voice.<br><br>"Myfirst white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers.It was 1924 and I'd just turned fifteen years old. Alton was a long,skinny baby with hair fine as silk on a corn...;"<br><br>I begin typing as she reads, her words rhythmic, pronounced more clearly thanher usual talk. "Every window in that filthy house was painted shut onthe inside, even though the house was big with a wide green lawn. Iknew the air was bad, felt sick myself...;"<br><br>"Hang on," I say. I've typed <i>wide greem</i>. I blow on the typing fluid, retype it. "Okay, go ahead."<br><br>"When the mama died, six months later," she reads, "of the lung disease, theykept me on to raise Alton until they moved away to Memphis. I lovedthat baby and he loved me and that's when I knew I was good at makingchildren feel proud of themselves...;"<br><br>I hadn't wanted toinsult Aibileen when she told me her idea. I tried to urge her out ofit, over the phone. "Writing isn't that easy. And you wouldn't havetime for this anyway, Aibileen, not with a full-time job."<br><br>"Can't be much different than writing my prayers every night."<br><br>It was the first interesting thing she'd told me about herself since we'dstarted the project, so I'd grabbed the shopping pad in the pantry."You don't say your prayers, then?"<br><br>"I never told nobody that before. Not even Minny. Find I can get my point across a lot better writing em down."<br><br>"Sothis is what you do on the weekends?" I asked. "In your spare time?" Iliked the idea of capturing her life outside of work, when she wasn'tunder the eye of Elizabeth Leefolt.<br><br>"Oh no, I write a hour, sometimes two ever day. Lot a ailing, sick peoples in this town."<br><br>I was impressed. That was more than I wrote on some days. I told her we'd try it just to get the project going again.<br><br>Aibileen takes a breath, a swallow of Coke, and reads on.<br><br>Shebacktracks to her first job at thirteen, cleaning the Francis the Firstsilver service at the governor's mansion. She reads how on her firstmorning, she made a mistake on the chart where you filled in the numberof pieces so they'd know you hadn't stolen anything.<br><br>"I comehome that morning, after I been fired, and stood outside my house withmy new work shoes on. The shoes my mama paid a month's worth a lightbill for. I guess that's when I understood what shame was and the colorof it too. Shame ain't black, like dirt, like I always thought it was.Shame be the color of a new white uniform your mother ironed all nightto pay for, white without a smudge or a speck a work-dirt on it."<br><br>Aibileenlooks up to see what I think. I stop typing. I'd expected the storiesto be sweet, glossy. I realize I might be getting more than I'dbargained for. She reads on.<br><br>"...;so I go on and get thechiffarobe straightened out and before I know it, that little white boydone cut his fingers clean off in that window fan I asked her to takeout ten times. I never seen that much red come out a person and I grabthe boy, I grab them four fingers. Tote him to the colored hospitalcause I didn't know where the white one was. But when I got there, acolored man stop me and say, <i>Is this boy white?</i>" The typewriterkeys are clacking like hail on a roof. Aibileen is reading faster and Iam ignoring my mistakes, stopping her only to put in another page.Every eight seconds, I fling the carriage aside.<br><br>"And I says <i>Yessuh, </i>and he say, <i>Is them his white fingers? </i>And I say, <i>Yessuh, </i>and he say, <i>Well you better tell them he your high yellow cause that colored doctor won't operate on a white boy in a Negro hospital. </i>And then a white policeman<i> </i>grab me and he say, <i>Now you look a here </i>"<br><br>She stops. Looks up. The clacking ceases.<br><br>"What? The policeman said <i>look a here </i>what?"<br><br>"Well, that's all I put down. Had to catch the bus for work this morning."<br><br>I hit the return and the typewriter dings. Aibileen and I look each other straight in the eye. I think this might actually work.<br><br><b>Chapter 12</b><br><br>Everyother night for the next two weeks, I tell Mother I'm off to feed thehungry at the Canton Presbyterian Church, where we, fortunately, knownot a soul. Of course she'd rather I go down to the First Presbyterian,but Mother's not one to argue with Christian works and she nodsapprovingly, tells me on the side to make sure I wash my handsthoroughly with soap afterward.<br><br>Hour after hour, inAibileen's kitchen, she reads her writing and I type, the detailsthickening, the babies' faces sliding into focus. At first, I'mdisappointed that Aibileen is doing most of the writing, with me justediting. But if Missus Stein likes it, I'll be writing the other maids'stories and that will be more than enough work. <i>If she likes it</i>...; I find myself saying this over and over in my head, hoping it might make it so.<br><br>Aibileen's writing is clear, honest. I tell her so.<br><br>"Well, look who I been writing to." She chuckles. "Can't lie to God."<br><br>BeforeI was born, she actually picked cotton for a week at Longleaf, my ownfamily's farm. Once she lapses into talking about Constantine withoutmy even asking.<br><br>"Law, that Constantine could sing. Like apurebred angel standing in the front a the church. Give everbodychills, listening to that silky voice a hers and when she wouldn't singno more after she had to give her baby to " She stops. Looks at me.<br><br>She says, "Anyway."<br><br>Itell myself not to press her. I wish I could hear everything she knowsabout Constantine, but I'll wait until we've finished her interviews. Idon't want to put anything between us now.<br><br>"Any word fromMinny yet?" I ask. "If Missus Stein likes it," I say, practicallychanting the familiar words, "I just want to have the next interviewset up and ready."<br><br>Aibileen shakes her head. "I asked Minny three times and she still say she ain't gone do it. I spec it's time I believed her."<br><br>Itry not to show my worry. "Maybe you could ask some others? See ifthey're interested?" I am positive that Aibileen would have better luckconvincing someone than I would.<br><br>Aibileen nods. "I got some more I can ask. But how long you think it's gone take for this lady to tell you if she like it?"<br><br>I shrug. "I don't know. If we mail it next week, maybe we'll hear fromher by mid-February. But I can't say for sure." Aibileen presses herlips together, looks down at her pages. I see something that I haven'tnoticed before. Anticipation, a glint of excitement. I've been sowrapped up in my own self, it hasn't occurred to me that Aibileen mightbe as thrilled as I am that an editor in New York is going to read herstory. I smile and take a deep breath, my hope growing stronger.<br><br>On our fifth session, Aibileen reads to me about the day Treelore died.She reads about how his broken body was thrown on the back of a pickupby the white foreman. "And then they dropped him off at the coloredhospital. That's what the nurse told me, who was standing outside. Theyrolled him off the truck bed and the white men drove away." Aibileendoesn't cry, just lets a parcel of time pass while I stare at thetypewriter, she at the worn black tiles.<br><br>On the sixth session,Aibileen says, "I went to work for Miss Leefolt in 1960. When MaeMobley two weeks old," and I feel I've passed through a leaden gate ofconfidence. She describes the building of the garage bathroom, admitsshe is glad it is there now. It's easier than listening to Hillycomplain about sharing a toilet with the maid. She tells me that I oncecommented that colored people attend too much church. That stuck withher. I cringe, wondering what else I've said, never suspecting the helpwas listening or cared.<br><br>One night she says, "I was thinking...;" But then she stops.<br><br>I look up from the typewriter, wait. It took Aibileen vomiting on herself for me to learn to let her take her time.<br><br>"I's thinking I ought to do some reading. Might help me with my own writing."<br><br>"Go down to the State Street Library. They have a whole room full of Southern writers. Faulkner, Eudora Welty "<br><br>Aibileen gives me a dry cough. "You know colored folks ain't allowed in that library."<br><br>Isit there a second, feeling stupid. "I can't believe I forgot that."The colored library must be pretty bad. There was a sit-in at thewhite library a few years ago and it made the papers. When the coloredcrowd showed up for the sit-in trial, the police department simplystepped back and turned the German shepherds loose. I look at Aibileenand am reminded, once again, the risk she's taking talking to me. "I'llbe glad to pick the books up for you," I say.<br><br>Aibileen hurries to the bedroom and comes back with a list. "I better mark theones I want first. I been on the waiting list for <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> at the Carver Library near bout three months now. Less see...;"<br><br>I watch as she puts checkmarks next to the books: <i>The Souls of Black Folk </i>by W.E.B. Du Bois, poems by Emily Dickinson (any), <i>The Adventures</i> <i>of Huckleberry Finn.</i><br><br>"I read some a that back in school, but I didn't get to finish." She keeps marking, stopping to think which one she wants next.<br><br>"You want a book by...;Sigmund Freud?"<br><br>"Oh,people crazy." She nods. "I love reading about how the head work.

Reprint.</p><p>I don't even like comic books, but I was completely enthralled by this book. The hefty 300 pages of high clay-content, color-saturated pages with over 700 illustrations and detailed text covers the 50-year history of the canonical comic books company which later became one of the industry's greatest innovators. Here there be artists highly skilled at depicting mayhem with clarity and precision, and writers who unerringly touch the (popular) collective unconscious. In addition to being highly praised within the comic book community, this book has also received rave reviews from mainstream magazines such as <i>Newsday</i> and <i>People</i>.The strongest impression one gets from this commemorative album is of the extraordinary skill with which Marvel Comics has hopped on the bandwagon throughout its 50-plus-year history. Timley Publications (Marvel's original name) started publishing superhero comics after Superman and Batman became prominent in the late 1930s (and stopped when the genre lost popularity after WW II), and romance and horror comics after competitors Prize Publications and EC Comics, respectively, popularized those genres in the late 1940s/early 1950s. When DC Comics's Justice League of America repopularized super-heroes, Marvel inaugurated its famous line of superhero comics, starting with The Fantastic Four in 1961. Daniels ( Living in Fear: The History of Horror in the Mass Media ) lays to rest the myth that Marvel publisher Lee (whose introduction is written in hyperbolic, adjective- and alliteration-laden prose) was the sole creator of those 1960s superheroes, which was Marvel's position until others in the field pushed to give proper credit to the artists who worked with Lee, especially Jack Kirby. The book does a fine job of documenting Marvel's overlooked pre-1961 background and is beautifully illustrated. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hot Wheels Racing U.S.A.

While her hollow-tree housemates (a ghost, a bat, and a gremlin) laze around, the little witch does all the unhousework&#x2013;hanging the cobwebs, dirtying the laundry, etc. When she finds some pumpkin seeds and plants them, she discovers that her friends are stubbornly unhelpful at every stage. While the little green witch's question is always, Who will help me...,' the answers are divertingly varied: Can't hear you,' said the bat. Water, schmater,' grouched the gremlin. As readers will expect, when the witch takes her pumpkin pie out of the oven, everyone is willing to help her eat it. Equally predictable is her refusal to share it. But she has an extra comeuppance up her ragged sleeve, one that will make readers laugh out loud. McGrath has done a fine job of meeting expectations while introducing surprises at every turn. Her gentle humor is amplified by Alexander's sweet and funny watercolor-pastel illustrations. Details like a Mickey Mouse cup on the shelf, a wood crate labeled Apples, and a cookie jar shaped like a little red hen can be discovered in successive readings. Children will enjoy this book before, during, and after Halloween.<i>&#x2013;Susan Weitz, formerly at Spencer-Van Etten School District, Spencer, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So turning back the clock to trace eighteen of the cases which helped establish his professional reputation was always going to be a fascinating experience. With his career still in its formative years, the panache with which Hercule Poirot could solve even the most puzzling mystery is obvious. Chronicled by his friend Captain Hastings, these eighteen early cases - from theft and robbery to kidnapping and murder - were all guaranteed to test Poirot&#39;s soon-to-be-famous &#39;little grey cells&#39; to their absolute limit.</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign countries. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.Be prepared to be charmed by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser reading this collection of 18 Agatha Christie short stories featuring Hercule Poirot. The two actors have for many years starred as Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings in the inimitable BBC specials imported by American public television. They clearly relish the material, however short it may be on plausibility, for they deliver the many pleasures with zest--the complex characters, well-set scenes, interesting villains, and, of course, Hastings and Poirot. Suchet reads most of the stories, and his performance, in particular, is one to treasure. On stage, one might say that he chews up the scenery. On tape, he mesmerizes, creating an unforgettable cast of characters and reading with such a nuanced sense of timing that one sees the action unfold as one listens. His reading is a generous gift to listeners.

New evidence clearly suggests that NASA hoaxed the photographs taken on the surface of the Moon. These disturbing findings are supported by detailed analysis of the Apollo images by professional photographer David S Percy ARPS and physicist David Groves PhD. The numerous inconsistencies clearly visible in the Apollo photographic account are quite irrefutable. Recent research indicates that the errors evidenced in DARK MOON were deliberately planted by individuals determined to leave clues to the faking in which they were unwillingly involved. DARK MOON is the answer to the question-did the Apollo missions really land a man on the Moon and return him alive and well to Earth, or is the record incorrect?</p><p>Mary Bennet and David Percy are professional researchers who have spent more than five years working on this book as well as a television documentary.

Pitching headlong into a very topical British cultural obsession with the nature of biography, The Biographer&#39;s Tale walks lightly the knotty tightrope between fact and fiction, and leaves the reader to decide on what is the difference between the two. As Phineas discovers, There are very few human truths and infinite variations on them...Reading and writing extend--not infinitely, but violently, gut giddily--the variations we can perceive on the truths we discover. --Rachel Holmes)</p><p>A.S. Byatt chronicles the life of the mind with the immediacy other novelists bring to the physical world. So when the graduate-student hero of <i>The Biographer's Tale</i> announces that he needs "a life full of <i>things</i>," we take his words with a grain of salt. Yes, Phineas G. Nanson has renounced the "cross-referenced abstractions" of life as a postmodern literary theorist, and vows to ground himself in what he warily calls the "facts" (the quotation marks are definitely in order). Yet he first forays into empiricism by reading a three-volume life of the Victorian traveler, writer, and diplomat Elmer Bole--then immediately undertakes a biography of Bole's biographer, Scholes Destry-Scholes.<p> <i>Things</i>, as Nanson discovers, can prove just as slippery as ideas. His research quickly leapfrogs beyond the biographer to his other subjects: scientist Carl Linnaeus, playwright Henrik Ibsen, and eugenicist Francis Galton, all of whom Destry-Scholes chronicled in three unpublished, unfinished, and, as it turns out, well-embroidered accounts. Meanwhile, our hero continues his forays into the real world. He takes a part-time job with a pair of gay travel agents, who arrange some very specialized vacations, and meets up with a Swedish bee taxonomist named Fulla, who wants to save the world. He also unearths a perplexing series of Destry-Scholes's index cards, full of sketches, facts, quotations, and unattributed lines of verse. These he attempts to shuffle into some kind of order, even as the enigmatic figure of the biographer himself seems to appear and disappear from view.</p><p> There are echoes here of Byatt's Booker Prize-winning <i>Possession</i>, another detective story for the MLA set. Yet <i>The Biographer's Tale</i> is an altogether odder--and chillier--sort of book. It is, in fact, almost terrifyingly learned, and wears its research about as lightly as a pair of Fulla's Ecco sandals. The mystery here is nothing less than the nature of mind, so it's no criticism to say that her characters have little life outside the ideas they represent. What's surprising is that the result is so readable, even beautiful at times. Here, for instance, is Nanson on truth and beauty: </p><blockquote> There are a very few human truths and infinite variations on them. I was about to write that there are very few truths about the world, but the truth about <i>that</i> is that we don't know what we are not biologically fitted to know, it may be full of all sorts of shining and tearing things, geometries, chemistries, physics we have no access to and never can have. Reading and writing extend--not infinitely, but violently, but giddily--the variations we can perceive on the truths we thus discover. </blockquote> The index cards themselves can be painful to read (remember the ersatz Victorian poetry in <i>Possession</i>?). But persevere, dear reader--meaning emerges through the play of one esoteric piece of information against another, just as it does in real life. Byatt extends her philosophical variations as far as she giddily can, and in <i>The Biographer's Tale</i>, she has constructed an elaborate, glittering labyrinth at the center of which lie surprisingly simple truths. <i>--Mary Park</i>From the award-winning author of "Possession comes an ingenious novel about love and literary sleuthing: a dazzling fiction woven out of one man's search for fact. <br>Here is the story of Phineas G. Nanson, a disenchanted graduate student who decides to escape the world of postmodern literary theory and immerse himself in the messiness of "real life" by writing a biography of a great biographer. In a series of adventures that are by turns intellectual and comic, scientific and sensual, Phineas tracks his subject to the deserts of Africa and the maelstrom of the Arctic. Along the way he comes to rely on two women, one of whom may be the guide he needs out of the dizzying labyrinth of his research and back into his own life. A tantalizing yarn of detection and desire, The Biographer's Tale is a provocative look at "truth" in biography and our perennial quest for certainty.</p><h2>Young Skins: Stories</h2><p><b>A National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 Honoree<br><br>Winner of the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, the <i>Guardian</i> First Book Award, and the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature</b><br><br>Enter the small, rural town of Glanbeigh, a place whose fate took a downturn with the Celtic Tiger, a desolate spot where buffoonery and tension simmer and erupt, and booze-sodden boredom fills the corners of every pub and nightclub.

Amongst them, there&#x2019;s jilted Jimmy, whose best friend Tug is the terror of the town and Jimmy&#x2019;s sole company in his search for the missing Clancy kid; Bat, a lovesick soul with a face like a bowl of mashed up spuds&#x201d; even before Nubbin Tansey&#x2019;s boot kicked it in; and Arm, a young and desperate criminal whose destiny is shaped when he and his partner, Dympna, fail to carry out a job. In each story, a local voice delineates the grittiness of post boom Irish society. These are unforgettable characters rendered through silence, humor, and violence.<br><br>Told in Barrett&#x2019;s vibrant, distinctive prose, <i>Young Skins</i> is an accomplished and irreverent debut from a singular new voice in contemporary fiction.</p><p>Colin Barrett was born in 1982 and grew up in County Mayo, Ireland. In 2009 he was awarded the Penguin Ireland Prize. His stories have appeared in Stinging Fly magazine, A Public Space, Five Dials, and the New Yorker.

Mr. Barrett makes him seamless and convincing: brutish but alive...Mr. Barrett does foundational things exceedingly well&#x2015;structure, choices of (and switches in) perspective&#x2015;without drawing attention to them. These are stories that are likely to be taught for their form...His judgment is better than authoritative; it is imaginative and enlarging."&#x2015;<strong><i>New York Times</i><br></strong><br>"Gritty...the stories often veer off in surprising narrative and stylistic directions...Barrett&#x2019;s voice, though bolstered by Irish tradition, is entirely his own."&#x2015;<strong><i>New Yorker</i><br></strong><br>&#x201c;Sharp and lively...a rough, charged, and surprisingly fun read."&#x2015;<strong><i>Interview</i> Magazine</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A writer to watch out for.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i><strong>Guernica<br></strong></i><br>"The stories blend moments of horror with moments of hilarity, shocks of joy with shocks of despair, and no matter how grim a given scene by Barrett can get, it&#x2019;s a thrill to be alive to hear him."&#x2015;<em><strong>Paris Review</strong></em> <br><br>"Young Irish writer Colin Barrett&#x2019;s subversive short story collection, <i>Young Skins</i>, may very well become my favorite book of 2015...<i>Young Skins</i> heralds a brilliant new age for Irish literature...Barrett&#x2019;s meticulously crafted narratives brim with plucky dialectical poetry so rhythmic it&#x2019;ll stick in your head like a three-chord punk song. These six stories and one novella brim also with the particular pleasure of a young writer operating with confidence and a wide-open heart. Rightly so: like James Joyce&#x2019;s <i>Dubliners</i> or Roddy Doyle&#x2019;s <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha</i> before him, Barrett proves that writing what you know can yield subversive and innovative results.&#x201d;&#x2015;<strong>Bustle</strong><br><br>"Mesmerizing...brutal, linguistically stylish tales of Sisyphean young men, voluntarily trapped within the confines of the fictional west of Ireland town of Glanbeigh."&#x2015;<strong>Electric Literature<br></strong><br>"Sometimes comic, sometimes melancholy, <i>Young Skins</i> touches the heart, as well as the mind."&#x2015;<strong><i>Irish American Post</i><br></strong><br>&#x201c;The collection&#x2019;s true impact comes in the gifted prose of Barrett, which flourishes in poetic and spare scenes; he is an assured, powerful new literary voice.&#x201d;&#x2015;<strong><i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred, boxed review)<br></strong><br>"Justly acclaimed for his lyrical, deadpan style by some of the giants of contemporary Irish literature, including Anne Enright and Colm T�ib�n, Barrett offers an extraordinary debut that heralds a brutal yet alluring new voice in contemporary fiction."&#x2015;<strong><i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br></strong><br>"Barrett knows the woods and roads surrounding Glanbeigh as well as he understands the youth who roam them. This is his territory, his people. He writes with beauty and a toughness that captures the essence of boredom and angst. Barrett has given us moments that resonate true to a culture, a population and a geography that is fertile with the stuff of good fiction."&#x2015;<i><strong>Kirkus</strong></i><br><br>"Many fiction writers are attracted to non-existent but identifiable settings. Thomas Hardy created Wessex, Robert Musil transformed Austria-Hungary into Kakania, and in Absalom, Absalom! William Faulkner literally mapped his Yoknapatawpha county. At once Lafayette, Mississippi, and not Lafayette, Mississippi, Yoknapatawpha offered readers a familiar setting without the danger of their imaginations snagging on the join between reality and fiction. Colin Barrett confidently secures this same blend of familiarity and freedom with the first line of his debut short-story collection...his stories invite second readings that...seem to uncover sentences that weren't there the first time around.

Colin Barrett has, as they say, talent to burn, but I really hope he doesn't waste a drop."&#x2015;<strong>Sam Lipsyte<br></strong><br>"Colin Barrett, like all great storytellers, has the ability to weave a broader chronicle of Ireland out of stories that remain intimate, powerful and regional. Out of the local, the universal appears. He defines the many shades of the present time and suggests a compelling future. He is a writer to savour and look out for."&#x2015;<strong>Colum McCann</strong><br><br>"Exciting and stylistically adventurous."&#x2015;<strong>Colm Toib�n<br></strong><br>"Colin Barrett's sentences are lyrical and tough and smart, but there is something more here that makes him a really good writer. His stories are set in a familiar emotional landscape, but they give us endings that are new. What seems to be about sorrow and foreboding turns into an adventure, instead, in the tender art of the unexpected."&#x2015;<strong>Anne Enright<br></strong><br>"Language, structure, style - Colin Barrett has all the weapons at his disposal, and how, and he has an intuitive sense for what a short story is, and what it can do."&#x2015;<strong>Kevin Barry<br></strong><br>"How dare a debut writer be this good? <i>Young Skins</i> has all the hallmarks of an instant classic. Barrett's prose is exquisite but never rarefied. His characters - the damaged, the tender-hearted and the reckless - are driven by utterly human experiences of longing. His stories are a thump to the heart, a mainline surge to the core. His vision is sharp, his wit is sly, and the stories in this collection come alive with that ineffable thing - soul."&#x2015;<strong>Alison MacLeod (judge of the 2014 Frank O'Connor Award)<br></strong><br>&#x201c;A writer of extraordinary gifts.

Fun and fastidiously researched facts about each era's animals and plants enhance the full-color spreads by&nbsp;<i>A State of Change</i> artist Laura Cunningham.

Sighs Dinah, "I think that we are quite likely to be bad, however hard we try not to be," and her sister Dorinda adds helpfully, "Very often, when we think we are behaving well, some grown-up person says we are really quite bad. It's difficult to tell which is which." Sure enough, the mischievous sisters soon convince a judge that minds must be changed as often as socks, stage an escape from the local zoo (thanks to a witch's potion which turns them into kangaroos), and&#x2014;in the company of a golden puma and silver falcon&#x2014;set off to rescue their father from the tyrant of Bombardy. A tale of hilarity and great adventure, <i>The Wind on the Moon</i> is also a work of high seriousness; after all, "life without freedom," as the valiant puma makes clear, "is a poor, poor thing."</p><p><b>Eric Linklater </b>(1899-1974) wrote scores of novels for adults and children.

Want to kick it old school? Julia Child's <i>Julia's Delicious Little Dinners</i> might just be the cookbook to help it all come together. Built around six dinners for six, this is not one of Julia Child's encyclopedic volumes on cooking. Instead, it's a lesson in menu planning--Julia lays out menus for different occasions, seasons, and tastes, carefully describing the entire process of planning a meal. Whether you're cooking roast beef for the boss or having rabbit and leek pie with friends, this book is ready to assist with whimsical suggestions on wine, presentation, and the pacing of courses. With an abundance of large pieces of meat and quaint little garnishes, the fare here leans toward the traditional. Julia's inclusion of dishes like Chicken Livers in Aspic seems refreshingly archaic in this era of "fusion cuisine." Nonetheless, the beautiful and very helpful technical photographs (depicting everything from butchering beef rib roasts to cleaning a leek) will dispel any doubt that this is a contemporary cookbook for the adept home cook. <i>--David Kalil</i>For an 8-cup baking dish, serving 8 people:<br><br>12 or more ears fresh corn (to make about 3 cups or � L cream-style grated corn)<br>6 eggs<br>2 to 3 Tb grated onion<br>1 tsp salt <br>4 to 5 Tb fresh minced parsley<br>2/3 cup (1� dL) lightly pressed down crumbs from crustless nonsweet white bread<br>2/3 cup (1� dL) lightly pressed down grated cheese (such as a mixture of Swiss and/or Cheddar or mozzarella)<br>2/3 cup (1� dL) heavy cream<br>6 drops hot pepper sauce (or 1/8 tsp Cayenne pepper)<br>8 to 10 grinds fresh pepper<br><br>Equipment<br>A corn scraper or grater; a straight-sided 8-cup (2-L) baking dish, such as a charlotte mold 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) deep, and a larger baking dish in which to set it.<br><br>Scrape or grate the corn and turn into a measure to be sure you have about 3 cups or � liter.

About 2 hours before serving, butter the 8-cup (2-L) baking dish and line bottom with a round of buttered wax paper. Stir up the corn mixture to blend thoroughly and pour into the dish. Set corn dish in larger dish and pour boiling water around to come two-thirds up the sides of the corn-filled dish. Bake in lower middle level of oven for half an hour, then turn thermostat down to 325�F/170�C. Baking time is around 1� to 1� hours, and water surrounding timbale should almost but never quite bubble; too high heat can make a custard (which this is) grainy. Timbale is done when it has risen almost to fill the mold, the top has cracked open, and a skewer plunged down through the center comes out clean. Let rest 10 minutes or more in turned-off oven, door ajar, before unmolding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be baked an hour or so before serving; the timbale will sink down as it cools, but who would ever know how high it might have been, once it is unmolded?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Any timbale leftovers can be sliced and eaten cold, or easily turned into a hot soup.

His ability to turn revolutionary philosophical ideas into brilliant social dramas inspired the likes of George Bernard Shaw, while his drive to manifest the truths of the human heart is mirrored in the plays of Anton Chekhov. Ibsen's genius, revealed in these four selections, lies in his startling abiliy to define his characters and their struggles, whih epitomize the inner conflicts that beset all human beings. A chilling play of manipulation and obsession, <i>Hedda Gabler</i> features one of the stage's most unforgettable modern heroines. A delightful early work, <i>Peer Gynt</i> is both a satire on the nature of man and a masterpiece of folklore and fantasy that follows the adventures of an irrepressible youth. Mysterious, lyrical, and tragic, <i>The Master Builder</i> symbolically dramatizes the trajectory of Ibsen's own art as well as the impossible aspirations of the soul. This Bantam Classic edition also includes <i>Little Eyolf</i>, a brilliantly consrtucted psychological study of paternal responsibility and the impact of a child's death on a man torn between two women.The three plays in this volume cover the period during which Ibsen (1828-1906) was preoccupied with realistic problems of personal and social morality. In The Pillars of the Community, partly by means of symbolism, he exposes the effects of a lie told to preserve a man&#39;s public reputation. The solution - to admit the truth - scarcely seemed so simple seven years later, when Ibsen completed The Wild Duck in apparent disillusionment. Hedda Gabler, the latest of these plays, is both a drama of individual conflict and partial return to social themes.</p><h2>Modern Classics Literature And Evil (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>&#39;Literature is not innocent,&#39; stated Georges Bataille in this extraordinary 1957 collection of essays, arguing that only by acknowledging its complicity with the knowledge of evil can literature communicate fully and intensely. These literary profiles of eight authors and their work, including Emily Bront�&#39;s Wuthering Heights, Baudelaire&#39;s Les Fleurs du Mal and the writings of Sade, Kafka and Sartre, explore subjects such as violence, eroticism, childhood, myth and transgression, in a work of rich allusion and powerful argument.</p><p>Georges Bataille, French essayist and novelist, was born in 1897. He converted to Catholicism, then to Marxism, and was interested in psychoanalysis and mysticism. As curator of the municipal library in Orleans, he led a relatively simple life, although he became involved, usually on the fringes, with the surrealist movement. He founded the literary review Critique in 1946, which he edited until his death in 1962, and was also a founder of the review Documents, which published many of the leading surrealist writers. His writing is a mixture of poetry and philosophy, fantasy and history, and his first novel, Story of the Eye, was written under the pseudonym of Lord Auch. Bataille&#39;s other works include the novels Blue of Noon, L&#39;Abb� C and My Mother, and the volumes of essays Eroticism and Literature and Evil.Bataille is one of the most important writers of the twentieth century -- Michel Foucault Bataille intellectualizes the erotic, as he eroticizes the intellect ... reading him can be a disturbing kind of game * The New York Times *</p><h2>Timing the Trade: How Price and Volume Move Markets</h2><p>Tom O&#39;Brien takes you from &#34;training wheels to rocket science&#34; in his new, all-encompassing hardcover book, Tom O&#39;Brien&#39;s Timing The Trade.

The bleak, eerie voice belongs to Francie Brady, the "pig boy," the only child of and alcoholic father and a mother driven mad by despair. Growing up in a soul-stifling Irish town, Francie is bright, love-starved, and unhinged, his speech filled with street talk, his heart filled with pain... his actions perfectly monstrous.</p><p> Held up for scorn by Mrs. Nugent, a paragon of middle-class values, and dropped by his best friend, Joe, in favor of her mamby-pamby son, Francie finally has a target for his rage -- and a focus for his twisted, horrific plan.</p><p> Dark, haunting, often screamingly funny, <i>The Butcher Boy</i> chronicles the pig boy's ominous loss of innocence and chilling descent into madness.

The moment Pauline, a stranger to the Polish Eastern Avenue neighborhood of Baltimore (though she lived only twenty minutes away), walked into his mother&#x2019;s grocery store, Michael was smitten. And in the heat of World War II fervor, they are propelled into a hasty wedding. But they never should have married.<br><br>Pauline, impulsive, impractical, tumbles hit-or-miss through life; Michael, plodding, cautious, judgmental, proceeds deliberately. While other young marrieds, equally ignorant at the start, seemed to grow more seasoned, Pauline and Michael remain amateurs. In time their foolish quarrels take their toll. Even when they find themselves, almost thirty years later, loving, instant parents to a little grandson named Pagan, whom they rescue from Haight-Ashbury, they still cannot bridge their deep-rooted differences. Flighty Pauline clings to the notion that the rifts can always be patched. To the unyielding Michael, they become unbearable. <br><br>From the sound of the cash register in the old grocery to the counterculture jargon of the sixties, from the miniskirts to the multilayered apparel of later years, Anne Tyler captures the evocative nuances of everyday life during these decades with such telling precision that every page brings smiles of recognition. Throughout, as each of the competing voices bears witness, we are drawn ever more fully into the complex entanglements of family life in this wise, embracing, and deeply perceptive novel.</p><p>Anne Tyler's <i>The Amateur Marriage</i> is not so much a novel as a really long argument. Michael is a good boy from a Polish neighborhood in Baltimore; Pauline is a harum-scarum, bright-cheeked girl who blows into Michael's family's grocery store at the outset of World War II. She appears with a bloodied brow, supported by a gaggle of girlfriends. Michael patches her up, and neither of them are ever the same. Well, not the same as they were before, but pretty much the same as everyone else. After the war, they live over the shop with Michael's mother till they've saved enough to move to the suburbs. There they remain with their three children, until the onset of the sixties, when their eldest daughter runs away to San Francisco. Their marriage survives for a while, finally crumbling in the seventies. If this all sounds a tad generic, Tyler's case isn't helped by the characteristics she's given the two spouses. Him: repressed, censorious, quiet. Her: voluble, emotional, romantic. Mars, meet Venus. What marks this couple, though, and what makes them come alive, is their bitter, unproductive, tooth-and-nail fighting. Tyler is exploring the way that ordinary-seeming, prosperous people can survive in emotional poverty for years on end. She gets just right the tricks Michael and Pauline play on themselves in order to stay together: "How many times," Pauline asks herself, "when she was weary of dealing with Michael, had she forced herself to recall the way he'd looked that first day? The slant of his fine cheekbones, the firming of his lips as he pressed the adhesive tape in place on her forehead." Only in antogonism do Michael and Pauline find a way to express themselves. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Anne Tyler was born in Minneapolis in 1941 but grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina.

A former creative writing teacher in western Washington, Ford lives in Oregon and is currently working on his next novel.</p>Chapter One <p>Nowadays, he was just a Pimp with a limp. A wiry specimen with a head too big for his body and a string of two dozen call girls he ran out of a limousine service in south Seattle. The girls called him Baby G, but I remembered a time when he was plain old Tyrone Gill, a playground legend who could take you off the dribble and stick it in the hole with the best of them. The Rocket Man, we'd called him ... after that old Elton John song. That was back before he made what he now liked to call "a series of unfortunate self-medication choices." Back before a rival procurer tried to amputate his foot in a Belltown alley. Back before a lot of things. For both of us.</p> <p>"Gonna call it Ho-Fest Two Thousand."</p> <p>He nudged me hard in the ribs. "Can you see it, man? The tents. The banners. The food stands."</p> <p>"Food stands?"</p> <p>I caught his feigned astonishment from the comer of my eye. "Man do not live by pussy alone," he said gravely.</p> <p>When I reckoned how he might be right, he went on.</p> <p>"Culturally coordinated, too, my man."</p> <p>"How's that?"</p> <p>"You know, man, like we got one tent set up for the regular trade. Missionary position types. Right next store we got some comfort food. Strictly meat and potatoes. Grits and gravy. That kinda. shit."</p> <p>"0h?"</p> <p>He cut a swath with his hand. "'Cross the way we got the Greek tent. You know ... for the backwards types."'</p> <p>I pulled one hand from the wheel and held it up. "No. No. Let me guess. Dolmas, kabobs, and rice pilaf."</p> <p>He grinned and nudged me again. His big head bobbed up and down like one of those spring-loaded dolls. "I knew you was a man of vision, Leo."</p> <p>Vision was precisely what I didn't have. The Explorer needed new wipers. Despite slapping back and forth at breakneck speed, the worn blades merely flattened the intermittent rain across the glass, smearing the muck into pulsating blobs of form and color that reminded me of long-ago light shows and psychedelic drugs. The unwanted memory tightened my lower jaw and sent a shiver sliding down MY spine. I clapped my free hand back onto the wheel and scrunched down in the seat, peering out at the thick traffic through a small, unsullied crescent of glass at the bottom of the windshield.</p> <p>Baby G snapped me back.</p> <p>"That's why you got to help me out wid this," he said. "Ain't nobody else could do it but you, man."</p> <p>I shook my head. "You got to get real here, G. No way anybody is going to give you a city permit to stage..." I looked over at him. "What did you say you wanted to call it?"</p> <p>He wore a blue silk suit. Three-piece. Tailored to him like it was made of iron. And a bright yellow tie.</p> <p>"Ho-Fest Two Thousand," he said.</p> <p>"'Not gonna happen in any city park, man. No point even talking about it."</p> <p>As G opened his mouth to protest, I leveled him with the coupe de grace. "Even my old man couldn't have pulled that shit off," I said.</p> <p>He recognized this as a serious rejoinder, indeed. His face clouded. He closed his mouth so hard he looked like a large mouth bass and then began staring sullenly out through the windshield. </p> <p>My old man had parlayed an early career as a union into eleven terms on the Seattle City Council. In the course of his storied thirty-year career of public service, Wild Bill Waterman had tilled previously unimagined ground in the fertile fields of influence peddling, insider trading and familial hiring preferences. When I turned forty-five, I was in line to inherit a bundle of ill-gotten downtown real estate, and to this day, twenty-five years after my father's death, nearly every city department is still being run by somebody related to me either by blood or by marriage.</p> <p>That's how come G had spent the ride from downtown filling my ear with his nonsense about wanting me to use my connections to help him get a permit to use Discovery Park conne for some kind of a superbowl of suction. Mostly, though, he was just talking to hear himself talk. He was nervous about our errand tonight. He wasn't letting on, but I could tell. Those huge hands were twitchy.</p> <p>"There's Darlene," she said.</p> <p>First time she'd spoken. G had introduced her as Narva. The professional makeup job made it hard to tell, but I made her to be about thirty. Better than six feet, light green contact lenses, short blond hair, smooth and curled under. Impeccable in a blue microfiber raincoat, she sat in the center of the backseat, her perfect face as smooth and unmoving as a figurine's. If I hadn't known better, I'd have made her for a corporate type. Big-time Ivy League. Stocks and bonds. Maybe a junior partner attorney. Never for a hooker. No way.</p> <p>Up ahead on the right, wedged between Watson's Plumbing Supply and a boarded-up beauty college, the Pine Tree Diner lurked in its own shadows, like one of those Edward Hopper paintings.

Set during the 1830s in a hellish island prison colony off the Tasmanian coast, the novel plucks a real-life thief and prisoner, English forger William Buelow Gould, from the pages of history to act as protagonist-narrator. Through Gould's unique capacity to blend hyperbole, hyperrealism, and self-effacing honesty, the reader acquires a shockingly clear picture of daily torment on the island. Yet more remarkable is Gould's portrait of bizarre ambitions among prison authorities to further principles of art and science amidst so much misery. Key to such plans is Gould's talent as a painter and illustrator. The compound's surgeon, nursing hopes of publishing a definitive guide to the island's fish, leans heavily on Gould's ability to record the taxonomy of various species. Though Gould accommodates his masters, the manuscript, in his hands, becomes testimony to their perverse dreams of civilization and his own quick-witted survival instincts. Throughout, Flanagan never loses the well-imagined voice of Gould's candor or the character's dense descriptive powers, talents that translate into a thrilling text that reads like a blend of Melville and Burgess. <i>--Tom Keogh</i>Richard Flanagan is the author of Death of a River Guide (Picador) and The Sound of One Hand Clapping (Picador), both of which were published to international acclaim.</p><h2>Total Wealth: Lifetime Wealth and Lifelong Security</h2><p>In <i>Total Wealth</i>, Bloomberg partner Mac Barnes shows you the secrets to earning money the easy way, the surefire way, the way that can make every person a millionaire.

A great read!&#39; - Bernard Cornwell. On the fields of Waterloo, the deserts of Sudan, the Plains of Abraham and the mountains of Dargai, the trenches of Flanders and the jungles of Burma - the great Highland regiments made their mark. The brave kilted troops with their pipes and drums were legendary, whether leading the charge into the thick of battle or standing fast, the last to leave or fall, fighting against the odds. Acclaimed historian Tim Newark tells the story of the Highlanders through the words of the soldiers themselves, from diaries, letters and journals uncovered from archives in Scotland and around the world. At the Battle of Quebec in 1759, only a few years after their defeat at Culloden, the 78th Highlanders faced down the French guns and turned the battle. At Waterloo, Highlanders memorably fought alongside the Scots Greys against Napoleon&#39;s feared Old Guard. In the Crimea, the thin red line stood firm against the charging Russian Hussars and saved the day at Balaclava. Yet the story is also one of betrayal. At Quebec, General Wolfe remarked that, despite the Highlanders&#39; courage, it was &#39;no great mischief if they fall&#39;. At Dunkirk in May 1940, the 51st Regiment was left to defend the SOE evacuation at St Valery; though following D-Day the Highlanders were at the forefront of the fighting through France. It is all history: over the last decade the historic regiments have been dismantled, despite widespread protest. Praise for &#34;The Mafia at War&#34;: &#39;An engrossing history that reads like a thriller, &#34;The Godfather&#34; meets &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; - Andrew Roberts. &#39;An engrossing account that has the read-on factor of the finest thriller. James Holland Newark tells an extraordinary tale with pace and conviction, and impressively unravels what really happened from the pervasive myths&#39; - &#34;History Today&#34;.</p><p><strong>Tim Newark </strong>was the editor for many years of&nbsp;<em>Military Illustrated</em>, the popular British military history magazine. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Camouflage</em>, <em>Highlander</em>, <em>The Mafia of War</em>, and has written for the <em>Financial Times</em> and the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. He lives in London, England.The famed kilted regiments with their pipes and drums march forth in this appealing history. A British military historian and consultant to several BBC documentaries, Newark (<i>The Mafia at</i><i>War</i>) opens on the stark landscape of geographical isolation: the Scottish Highland settlements. The first Highlanders&#x2014;unemployed farmers, enforcers, mercenaries, bandits, rebels&#x2014;had a fierce reputation, and by the early 16th century, the Highlanders' image was already set... as an untamed tartan-clad warrior who rushed upon his enemy like a wild animal. Newark takes the reader directly onto the battlefields, from the 1746 Battle of Culloden and the New York Highlanders' 1861 baptism of fire at Bull Run to fighting in France and Burma during WWII. A closing chapter surveys the Highlander as depicted in ads, novels, films, and toy soldiers. The book benefits from exhaustive research, unpublished manuscripts, memoirs, and letters: I clove a piece out of one of their heads just as one does an egg for breakfast and saw his white brain exposed. Such statements by the Highlanders themselves, which Newark unearthed, make for a powerful portrait of ferocity and courage. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos. <i>(Apr. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During his career of some fifty years, Watkins traveled the western United States, making thousands of remarkable, historically important images. From pictures of Yosemite, the Pacific Coast, and the scenery along the Columbia River to photographs of the vast mining tracts of the Sierra Nevada and the towns springing up along the recently built Central and Southern Pacific railroads, these images provide an unparalleled visual record of the West.<br>Carleton Watkins: The Art of Perception examines the signal achievement of this photographic innovator in the context of burgeoning western development and new ways of experiencing the world visually.<br>Produced using state-of-the-art tritone printing, it showcases over one hundred of the photographer's best images, including several of Watkins's extraordinary multi-part panoramic works. The photographs, many of which have never been exhibited or reproduced before, are accompanied by essays that are informed by substantial original research into Watkin's life and ambitions.</p><p>Victorian landscape photographer Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) described his lifelong project in simple terms: to find "the best spot with the best view." However, this self-trained but precocious man, who seemed to delight in giving away much of the work he produced, is now considered one of the most gifted American photographers of the 19th century. Perhaps best known for his pictures of the then newly discovered scenic wonder Yosemite, Watkins made thousands of remarkable, sophisticated, and historically important images that provide an unparalleled visual record of the western United States. In his spectacular depictions of the West Coast's natural resources and the industrial outposts nested within them by way of the California Gold Rush and the Central and Southern Pacific Railroads, Watkins captured the sense of adventure and expansionist enthusiasm of the mid-1800s American imagination. <p> In the photo <i>Sugar Loaf Islands, Farallons</i>, the combination of grand scale and lush detail draws the viewer into an arresting image in which a single jagged rock emerges from a smoky mist. Only upon closer inspection does one discover that the shiny pebbles at its base are actually about a hundred glistening seals who loll along the beach of a mammoth island. Throughout his 50-year career, Watkins traveled tirelessly under adverse conditions to remote sites, often by mule. He carried cumbersome equipment, including his giant camera, which was custom-made by a cabinetmaker. And he secured his hard-earned images on fragile glass-plate negatives. Watkins's adventuring laid the groundwork for his pioneering in the nascent art and technique of photography. His work commanded wonder and respect from large audiences on both coasts, and the sheer beauty of his pictures helped set a national policy of scenic conservation that preceded the present system of national parks. </p><p> <i>Carleton Watkins: The Art of Perception</i> is a companion volume to the first large-scale exhibition to look at this photographer's work from a critical, art-historical perspective. The show originates at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., through the year 2000. Produced using state-of-the-art tritone printing, this catalog includes 125 of Watkins's best images--stereo cards and multipart panoramic works among them. Accompanying the photographs are compelling and informative essays by Douglas Nickel, associate curator of photography at SFMOMA, and Maria Morris Hambourg, curator in charge of the Department of Photographs at the Met, as well as Peter E. Palmquist's notes on the plates, a list of selected references, and a chronology. <i>--A.C. Smith</i></p>Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) was perhaps the greatest American landscape photographer of the 19th century. His groundbreaking images of Yosemite, the Columbia River, and other natural wonders captured the grandeur of the American West for audiences around the world-and set an aesthetic standard rivaled only in the work of Ansel Adams many years later. This companion volume to a major traveling exhibition is the most beautiful book on Watkins&#39; work ever published. Produced using state-of-the-art tritone printing, it showcases 105 of the photographer&#39;s exquisitely composed images, including four gatefolds presenting Watkins&#39; astonishing panoramic photographs.

He pulled the U-Haul behind the house, where no one would spot him from the road. Starlight grayed the black of early night when he turned out the headlights and killed the engine. He sat for one moment, gripping the steering wheel. His stomach knotted at all there was to face and do here. Starting right now.<br><br>He climbed down, stiff and sore from the long drive, waging war with himself for calm, even for courage. His new house, like his new life, was an old one, but he'd make it right, make everything right from cellar to roof, inside and out. He was taking his life's biggest step forward by taking many steps back.<br><br>He unlatched the back doors of the truck and yanked them open. From the dark cavern loaded with his meager possessions, piles of wood, and handmade furniture, he dragged out his toolbox and flopped it open on the grass. He strapped on his leather tool belt, jammed wire cutters, screwdriver, metal snips, a claw hammer, and needle-nose pliers in the pockets. Pulling on leather work gloves, he grabbed a saw.<br><br>He scraped his tall stepladder out, hefted it next to the back porch, and jerked it open. With his flashlight wedged in his belt, he climbed to the porch roof, then to the steeper shingled roof of the house. He hunkered down next to the tall television antenna and began to work.<br><br>In five minutes he had cut the antenna loose. He shoved it over the side. It crashed two stories down, shuddered, and lay still.<br><br>Next, he dug at the nails and metal bands securing the two old lightning rods, but did not toss them over. They would fetch a good price as antiques at the Saturday morning auction in Pleasant.<br><br>He gazed at the plain, clean roofline with relief, for it would publicly declare his commitment to all who rode by. Sweating in the cool breeze, Daniel thrust aloft the rods like trophies of his victory. He had conquered himself; he had come home.<br><br>Slowly, he lowered the rods to his knees and gazed down from his precarious perch. The dark bulk of the U-Haul waiting to be unloaded was his last link to his previous life. He had snapped the radio off once he crossed the state line from Indiana, right in the middle of that bouncy-beat chorus he loved in "Achy Breaky Heart." He didn't mind giving up country music for good, he tried to convince himself. After he turned the truck in tomorrow, he'd never drive again, either.<br><br>The only lights he could see were from Verna Sprigg's Sewing Circle Shop and its second-story living quarters across the field. Two large farms, his own family's and his sister Emma's in-laws', lay beyond his lot line, but kerosene lanterns could never be spotted from here. No traffic on the road, nothing but star speckles overhead until he watched the full moon, big as a ripe peach, roll over the hilly horizon. It was a stunning sight, but he had things to do.<br><br>The knot in his stomach yanked tight again as he scooted crab-like from the roof, to the porch, and descended the ladder. He laid the lightning rods in the grass. Under the clay pot where Emma said it would be, he found the key. He unlocked the creaky back door and went in. The interior smelled of vinegar, lemon, and soap; Emma had written that she and her girls would have it spick-and-span for him.<br><br>He turned on no lights and never would here&#x2014;not the electric, anyway. Tomorrow he would disconnect it and have the wires pulled soon, the ones for the telephone, too, for he hoped to bring a good, Plain woman here, one he could trust and, hopefully, someday love.<br><br>In the empty living room, the thick soles of his work boots sank into what Emma had described as fairly new wall-to-wall carpet, thick and green as grass, you won't believe it, Dan. He flicked off the f lashlight and stood silent. But even in the dark, he saw pairs of white, fancy, ruff led draperies at each window like graceful ghosts bowing to a partner for a dance. He yanked them all down and hurled them in a corner.<br><br>Tears burned Brooke Benton's eyes as she listened to her niece Jennifer's closing to her bedtime prayer to "please tell my mommy I still love her. Especially because it's Mother's Day. And good night, God. Amen."<br><br>Brooke bent down to kiss the child's forehead. "You know," Brooke said, "God has a very good memory, so maybe you don't need to remind Him of that every night, because then both of us just start crying."<br><br>"Yes, but <em>she </em>used to forget things sometimes. When she was sick, I had to tell her some stuff again and again. So I'm asking Him to remind <em>her,</em>" Jennifer insisted in her seven-year-old's logic that often amazed Brooke.<br><br>"Come on now. It's hit the hay time, as Mrs. Spriggs says," Brooke urged, plumping up her pillow and trying to make her voice light. "That Monday-morning school bus will be here bright and early, Jen."<br><br>"I guess Daddy would be mad at me for going to bed late, don't you think?"<br><br>Brooke sank back on the edge of the four-poster bed and gently stroked Jennifer's hair. "No, I'm sure he'd understand that we were just having fun. I told you he's not mad at you for anything."<br><br>Frowning, the petite, blue-eyed blonde looked away to arrange her two dolls, leaned against the other pillow. They were totally mismatched: the small, molded plastic, adolescent Skipper doll had been Jennifer's mother Melanie's years ago; the soft, faceless Amish baby doll, named Nettie, was a recent gift from her friend Susie.<br><br>"I know," Jennifer said, her voice shaky with exhaustion and emotion, "that Daddy's not mad at me because Mommy died. That wasn't anyone's fault but cancer."<br><br>"That's right" was all Brooke could manage, but even then her voice broke. She still stroked Jennifer's hair; the child sighed and turned onto her side to cuddle into her deep down pillow. After tucking the sheet and quilt around Jennifer's thin shoulders, Brooke rubbed her niece's back, went out, and snapped off the light. A floorboard creaked loudly, but it would take a bomb to wake Jennifer once she fell asleep in this pretty haven of her room.<br><br>The bed, pillow, quilt, the rag rugs on the floor&#x2014;Brooke thought again how this old but vibrant house and store below were just like their owner, Verna Spriggs. Brooke missed her, but it had been her suggestion that Verna seize the chance for a long visit to her son's family in Maine. And immersing herself in Verna's duties made her feel useful as well as safe and sane again.<br><br>Brooke went downstairs to the big quilting room where she and Jennifer had been practicing line dancing with a videotape called <em>Country Dance Time. </em>Learning the Elvira and the Tush Push to the lilting, rhythmic tunes was one of many shared activities that bound them closer. Tonight Jennifer had gotten so into it, she seemed to temporarily forget her troubles, too.<br><br>Brooke pulled the quilted cover off the TV again&#x2014;for when it was not in use, they kept it draped in deference to the Amish who came here&#x2014;and rewound the tape to lesson one, the grapevine step. With the sound turned low, in her jeans, T-shirt, and beat-up boots, she did the grapevine around the room&#x2014;step, behind, step, kick&#x2014;while she straightened the quilts for sale on their circular revolving racks, retacked price cards for pieced wall hangings and table runners on the peg-board display, and aligned booklets and supply boxes on shelves. Monday morning would come too soon for her, too.<br><br>The two group quilts in progress&#x2014;a Courthouse Steps and a Drunkard's Path&#x2014;stretched on their separate rectangular frames needed no tending, for the Amish women who stitched them always left things immaculately ordered. Her only real Amish friend so far, Emma Kurtz, who oversaw things, made certain of that.<br><br>But Brooke noticed some scraps under one quilt where Emma's youngest, Susie, and Jennifer had been playing house on Saturday. She crawled under to pick those up. The vacuum didn't reach clear under here, anyway.<br><br>She jumped when she heard a knock&#x2014;and on the back door at this hour. Her heart thudding, she scrambled out from under the quilt, then calmed herself as she snapped on the kitchen light and walked to the back door. This was not the city, she scolded herself, and he&#x2014;or them&#x2014;couldn't possibly find her here. It was probably just an Amish person wanting to use the phone.<br><br>She peered out through the window and smiled in relief. Emma's eldest child, Katie, age eighteen, who came with her to quilt if she was not tending the house or her siblings, stood there with three others. Holding Katie's hand until the door opened was Gideon Stoltz, Maplecreek's blacksmith's son, whom Brooke knew Katie had been dating. Behind them stood two other young people about Katie's age whom Brooke did not know.<br><br>"Your lights, we saw them still on," Katie said. "Stop by with Gid anytime for an ice-cream bar, you said&#x2014;that Ha&#x2014;Hagens..."<br><br>"H�agen-Dazs. Yes, please, all of you, come in."<br><br>"This is Cora Troyer, my best run-around friend, and this is her come-calling friend, Ezra Yoder," Katie told her, blushing ever so slightly under the freckles speckling her cheeks and pert nose.<br><br>The girls removed their black shawls and bonnets, leaving their white starched <em>kapps </em>covering the back of their heads. All Amish women wore their uncut tresses parted in the center and swept straight back in a hidden knot. Katie's green eyes looked huge behind her wire-framed glasses, especially because her dress was emerald green. How much she looked like Emma, even the glasses, Brooke thought, warmed by the fact these four had come to visit. It showed her acceptance in the community was growing, even without Verna, whom the Maplecreek Amish had known and trusted for years.<br><br>The boys did not remove their straw hats, nor do more than nod. No <em>pleased to meet you'</em>s, and Brooke knew to expect no <em>thank you'</em>s or even a <em>good-bye. </em>For such polite pleasantries were deemed "fancy" or "prideful" by the Plain People, who tried as best they could to live separate from what they called worldly folk. At least, that evidently did not mean avoiding an outsider named Brooke Benton or the rich ice-cream bars that were her worst edible indulgence.<br><br>"Now, each of you choose what one you'd like," she prompted after she had trooped them down past shelves of fabric bolts into the back basement storage room and lifted the heavy lid of Verna's old chest freezer. Most of it was filled with food stored here for Katie's family, who bartered home-baked bread and canned goods for its use. Brooke had taken to keeping her storehouse of chocolate ecstasy down here so she wasn't tempted every time she got an ice cube from the kitchen.<br><br>When the four of them just stared down into the swirl of frosted air, Brooke prompted, "Let's see, we have Heath Toffee or Snickers Ice-Cream Bars, you know, like frozen candy bars. Maybe you should all try a different one and compare."<br><br>She should have known they'd all take the same kind so as not to look special or individual. They selected H�agen-Dazs as, she surmised, the ersatz name sounded German to them. Upstairs, she gave them napkins and pulled five chairs from around the quilting frames into a circle.<br><br>"Any day now my Uncle Daniel will come home and be your neighbor," Katie offered in the silence as paper wrappers ripped and crinkled open. "Clear from Goshen, Indiana."<br><br>"Your mother told me he bought the old Whitman place across the field," Brooke responded. "I hear they had modernized it."<br><br>"Mm," Gideon said with his mouth full. "If he's really back to join the church, he'll have to convert it back. The black sheep comes home. Daniel Brand could tell us how to have a good, long <em>rumspringa, </em>I bet, yeah."<br><br>Cora said with her mouth half full, "The running-around time our young people have to try different things in life&#x2014;even in the world&#x2014;that's <em>rumspringa. </em>To see if we really want to commit to being Amish."<br><br>"The whole church will be glad to have Uncle Daniel home," Katie picked up her original topic. "My grandfather Jacob, especially."<br><br>"I'm sure it is hard for the bishop to have his own son living away from the family and church," Brooke said.<br><br>"In church this morning, Grandfather talked about it. But just now, heading home from a hymn sing, that's where we were," Katie explained, licking her chocolate instead of biting into it. "By midnight I'm supposed to be in the house&#x2014;what you English call a curfew, Miss Brooke."<br><br>Gideon scooted his chair slightly closer to Katie's as she spoke. "His own buggy, Ezra has one, too, for courting, but it broke an axle, so tonight we came together."<br><br>"I'm so glad you did. I know how much Katie likes ice cream, and I told her she hadn't lived until she'd had a H�agen-Dazs."<br><br>They nodded, and Brooke realized how silly it must sound to hear someone English, as the Amish called non-Amish, claim an ice-cream bar made any sort of difference in one's life. In just a few years these four would probably be committed to their church, married, and rearing families. And here, at age thirty-one, she had done none of those big, life-shaping things.<br><br>"A lot of fun gadding about," Ezra said, "like telling riddles. Know how to double your money real easy, Miss Brooke?"<br><br>"No, but I wish I did," Brooke replied, willing to play straight man to these very straight kids. Their wholesome na�vet� always struck some strange chord in her.<br><br>"To double your money real easy, just fold it in half," Ezra said, then had to dive for his ice cream to keep from losing a huge chunk of chocolate. As they all laughed, Brooke noticed that Ezra sported a forbidden wristwatch and all four of them wore Reebok running shoes.<br><br>"The English&#x2014;well, I don't mean you and Mrs. Verna&#x2014;got the wrong idea about Plain People," Katie declared when she saw Brooke looking at their feet. "Like we're sticks-in-the-mud or something. Our own fun, we have plenty of that, and we've been around a worldly place or two, uh-huh."<br><br>"I'll bet you have," Brooke managed, fighting to keep a smile from her lips.<br><br>"Promise you won't tell my mother?" Katie asked, leaning forward in her chair. Brooke didn't want to know something taboo she couldn't tell Emma. But what could this bunch possibly have done bad?<br><br>"I won't tell," she vowed.<br><br>"That dinosaur movie, we saw it in Pleasant," Katie whispered.<br><br>"<em>Jurassic Park? </em>I wouldn't let Jennifer see that."<br><br>"Real scary," Katie said, almost gloating while the others smiled. "People screamed right out and everything. We dressed English, we saw it, and <em>fressed, </em>too."<br><br></p><h2>Blink-182: Tales from Beneath Your Mom</h2><p>They're young.

But Hall, now an elderly physicist living in England, claims he was also very naive. While working to develop the atomic bomb for the United States, Hall approached Soviet intelligence and proceeded to pass along secrets. His breaches of security, while unknown outside intelligence circles until recently, dwarf the work of better-known Cold War operatives. And what's perhaps most startling is his motivation for giving the Soviets the secrets of the American bomb. Relying on recently declassified materials and interviews with the participants in the plot, <i>Bombshell</i> reads like an inventive spy novel, yet it's entirely true.<br>"<b>Bombshell</b>combines outstanding research and compelling narrative. It's amazing and fascinating--the best report we shall ever have on the <b>American</b> physicist spy at Los Alamos who stole the plans for the atomic bomb and gave them to the Russians."<br>--Richard Rhodes, author of <b>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</b> and <b>Dark Sun</b><p>"Albright and Kunstel do an excellent job of clarifying the complex processes involved in making the atomic bomb, pausing even to explain various false starts and unworkable procedures that often preceded the program's periodic breakthroughs".<br> --Allen Weinstein, <b>Los Angeles Times Book Review</b></p><p></p></p><h2>Our Own Snug Fireside: Images of the New England Home, 1760-1860</h2><p>Offers a detailed look at home life in New England from colonial times to the eve of the Civil War, clears up misconceptions about the period, and looks at gender roles, household economies, prosperity, poverty, and community ritual</p><p>JANE C. NYLANDER is Director of Strawbery Banke Museum in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. During her career, she's been a consultant to and president of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities in Boston; has taught at the University of New Hampshire, Boston University, and New England College; and has been curator of textiles and ceramics at Old Sturbridge Village. <p>RICHARD C. NYLANDER is Chief Curator and Director of Collections for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities in Boston. In 1990, he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush and, in 2002, was reappointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.</p>A fact-filled, copiously illustrated, revealing survey of Yankee life and households in an earlier time, complied by Boston- based curator Nylander (Director/Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities). Drawing on an array of original documents and records-- especially on a handful of diaries written by New England women of the period--Nylander offers a substantive view of household life during a time that saw the nation established and its northern regions industrialized. The images the author presents are often those in which female activities or concerns predominate, although the male presence in the home is by no means given short shrift. The family ``unit'' in pre-Civil War America, Nylander explains, included nonnuclear members as well as boarders, hired help, and, frequently, young married couples preparing to create a household of their own--with daily routines consisting not only of meal preparation and house cleaning but also of spinning, sewing, and preparing for a variety of future events, from marriage to parties and other social gatherings. Changes in technology prompted immense shifts in these routines, with, for instance, iron stoves replacing the massive kitchen fireplaces and commercial weaving offering greater variety than the homemade product. But while the agricultural or village aspects of New England living generally dominate this account, the emphasis clearly is on more well-to-do families rather than their more numerous, poorer--and less literate--neighbors. Not comprehensive, then, and at times overly reliant on diary excerpts--but informative, and valuable for its many glimpses of American interiors.

Reprint.</p><p>You can't lose for winning--especially, it would seem, if you're Joe Haldeman. Suffering the same fate as many an author who's dared to pen unconventional sequels to a ferociously loved book (in this case, <i>The Forever War</i>), Haldeman has risked the ire of his many devoted admirers a second time (the first sequel was the award-spangled <i>Forever Peace</i>). But Haldeman's call--not too surprisingly--proves to be a deft one, giving us a book that, while significantly different from its predecessor, turns out to be equally captivating and sensitive, in many ways even more thought-provoking. (Sure, it doesn't match <i>The Forever War</i> for sheer impact, but then again, what does?)<p> As in <i>The Forever War</i>, the heart of this story is the dry, ironic bite of fighting-suit vet William Mandella, now middle-aged and a parent (along with his love and comrade-in-arms Marygay) to two teen-aged kids. The family leads a spartan life on the cold and desolate planet Middle Finger, which serves as a sort of genetic safe-deposit box for the current incarnation of humanity, an inhuman race of group-mind clones known as Man. But the animals in the zoo are getting restless, and a core group of vets led by William and Marygay plot an unusual escape: hijacking a reconditioned time ship and using it to take a 40,000 light-year tour (over 10 years of their own time) to rejoin the world they know only after 2,000 generations have passed. Much of the action involves the hatching and fruition of this plot, but Haldeman doesn't really mix things up until nearing the end, when he dissolves physics as we know it and calls down the wrath of God itself. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Joe Haldeman is a Hugo and Nebula Award winner.

In the four years since she left England, Maisie Dobbs has experienced love, contentment, stability&#x2014;and the deepest tragedy a woman can endure. Now, all she wants is the peace she believes she might find by returning to India. But her sojourn in the hills of Darjeeling is cut short when her stepmother summons her home to England; her aging father Frankie Dobbs is not getting any younger.</p><p>But on a ship bound for England, Maisie realizes she isn&#x2019;t ready to return. Against the wishes of the captain who warns her, &#x201c;You will be alone in a most dangerous place,&#x201d; she disembarks in Gibraltar. Though she is on her own, Maisie is far from alone: the British garrison town is teeming with refugees fleeing a brutal civil war across the border in Spain.</p><p>Yet the danger is very real. Days after Maisie&#x2019;s arrival, a photographer and member of Gibraltar&#x2019;s Sephardic Jewish community, Sebastian Babayoff, is murdered, and Maisie becomes entangled in the case, drawing the attention of the British Secret Service.

Grieving for the man who raised her, Francesca is stunned to find an unsigned letter among his effects, cursing the Hattons and their descendants. Now a stranger has shown up on her doorstep, accusing her grandfather of being a murderer.<br> <br>Ex-soldier Richard Leighton blames Francis Hatton for the death of his mother, who vanished nearly a quarter of a century earlier. Her body was never found, only a shawl stained with her blood. And Leighton is not the only one with a claim on Francesca&#x2019;s grandfather. On the day of his funeral, unexpected visitors arrive with the mourners, and Francesca is besieged by charges of Hatton&#x2019;s vicious dealings. Yet there is also a shy young woman who praises his secret generosity.<br><br>At the center of the intrigue is an unusual white stone that lies hidden in a secluded garden where Francesca once played with her five male cousins, all of them dead now on the battlefields of France. According to the terms of Hatton&#x2019;s will, the Murder Stone must be dug up and transported to Scotland, where it is to be buried forever. But before Francesca can begin the journey, a series of ominous &#x201c;accidents&#x201d; occur, culminating in the discovery of a bleeding body on the Murder Stone itself.<br><br>Was Hatton the loving, caring protector his granddaughter always believed him to be? <br>Or a vindictive, secretive man who cultivated dangerous enemies? Francesca sets out in pursuit of the truth&#x2014;and into the sights of someone determined to exact a revenge long overdue.</p><p>How well do we really know the people we love? Maybe never well enough, to judge by the example of Francesca Hatton, the young British heiress around whom Charles Todd constructs his first standalone historical suspense tale, <i>The Murder Stone</i>. Leaving London and her volunteer work with wounded World War I soldiers, Francesca--"the last of the Hattons ... [a] long and distinguished line"--returns in 1916 to River's End, the rural estate where her powerful and beloved grandfather is dying of a stroke. Francis Hatton's passing hits Francesca hard, especially coming so soon after the demise of her five male cousins, all of them "mown down with their dreams of glory" in battle. But her mourning is interrupted by multiple mysteries. Why did Francis insist in his will that the Murder Stone, a large and cryptically named white rock in his garden, be moved to the farthest corner of Scotland? Why had he concealed his ownership of two other, distant estates? And could there be any truth in the charge, leveled by an invalided soldier, that Francis long ago "abducted and killed his mother, then buried the body where it couldn't be found"? Forced by new revelations to rebalance her faith in the man who'd taken her in as an orphaned child, while simultaneously contending with a random sniper who's invaded the neighborhood of River's End, Francesca struggles to build a new future, even as her trust in the "facts" of her past crumbles.<p> Over the course of six previous novels, beginning with <i>A Test of Wills</i>--all featuring shell-shocked soldier-turned-inspector Ian Rutledge--Todd (the nom de plume of a mother-son writing team) has shown considerable skill in formulating criminal conundrums against the backdrop of post-World War I Britain. <i>The Murder Stone</i> vividly recaptures the nation in the very midst of that international violence, a painful period of untimely deaths and stunning Zeppelin raids. However, this yarn is as much a Gothic romance as an abstruse puzzler. Most of the secrets here can be figured out faster by the average reader than by the incredibly na�ve Francesca. And with the exception of that vexed protagonist, whose investigations paint her into ever tighter moral corners, none of this novel's characters achieve much dimension. They're mechanical players in a drama that is surprising mostly for its failure to surprise. <i>--J.

The appearance of the Fifth Goddess has heralded a darker turn in the story - as we are reminded that behind the adorable form of chibi-Hild lies a fearsome demonic intent.

The stricken pair cannot survive long in this state... and Belldandy is the next target.

Within these occupied lands, Jews were being rounded up and sent off to extermination camps for execution. Helping them escape was punishable by death.</p><p> In this dark and seemingly hopeless situation, hundreds of ordinary people risked all to shelter and smuggle Jews to safety. These were generally not organized efforts, simply moral people who reacted in horror to the fate of innocent neighbors and took action. Thousands of Jews were rescued in this way.</p><p> In 1953, the state of Israel established Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem to commemorate and perpetuate the memory of the heroes and martyrs of the Holocaust. An independent committee reviews and awards the honor of The Righteous Among the Nations to those documented cases of rescue. Over 20,000 people, from all nationalities and religious groups, have received this prestigious awards. </p><p> This work selects approximately 200 biographies from among the Righteous, and describes the circumstances of the rescue. Each entry includes description of the contact; the aid extended; dangers and risk faced by the rescuer; motivation (eg, friendship, altruism, religious belief); and evidence from the rescued. These little&#x2013;known stories offer a picture of the best of humanity in the worst of times.</p></p><p>This moving tribute to the best in the human spirit profiles more than 150 recipients of the Yad Vashem "Righteous Among the Nations" award, given to non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. They are just a few of the 21,310 who have received the award since its inception in 1963. The award grants honorary Israeli citizenship, but more than that, it acknowledges a high level of moral heroism. It is notable that most of the subjects do not see themselves as heroic but as following the only path they could. In the words of Lucien Bunel, when asked why he had disobeyed the laws against sheltering Jews, "I know of only one law, that of the gospels and of love." Each entry is told in narrative form, conversationally, as in a memoir. The result is a volume that is not only highly readable but that excerpts well for use in talks and lectures. In some cases, black-and-white photographs of the subjects of the entries are provided. Narratives center mostly on occupied Europe but also include humanitarians from the U.S. and Japan. The heavy paper and clarity of the photographs, along with the excellent use of white space, make the book a delight to use. A detailed index includes names of those rescued, the rescuers, and places that figured in their activities. A list of rescuers by country and a selected bibliography are also provided. A more condensed treatment than Israel Gutman's The Encyclopedia of the Righteous Among the Nations (Yad Vashem, 2004&#x2013;2007), this inspiring volume has a place in synagogue libraries as well as any library with a demand for materials on the topic.

He lives in the New York City metropolitan area.Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;Designed with boldly colored graphics and simple lines, this book takes a contemporary approach to an old topic. While the artwork employs icons and images from ancient Rome, the text introduces Roman numerals by citing modern examples of how they are used: to number chapters and pages in books, on watch faces, and for sports events. Taking a unique approach, Adler suggests that students use coins, each labeled with a specific Roman numeral, to better understand the symbols and how they are written and counted. Several examples are depicted and explained. For the most part, the writing is forthright and easy to understand. However, the page that describes which Roman numerals can be subtracted from which (e.g., "C can only be subtracted from D or M") is a bit confusing. The book ends with a spread of photos showing how Roman numerals are used today, and the back cover presents a helpful list of Roman numerals and their Arabic equivalents.

He has won many awards, including the Carnegie Medal, the Guardian Children&#39;s Book Award and the Whitbread Book of the Year Award. His acclaimed trilogy, His Dark Materials, has been published in thirty-nine languages and sold tens of millions of copies. He lives in Oxford with his wife, and has two sons.Mary and Joseph<br>&nbsp;<br>This is the story of Jesus and his brother Christ, of how they were born, of how they lived and of how one of them died. The death of the other is not part of the story.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the world knows, their mother was called Mary. She was the daughter of Joachim and Anna, a rich, pious and elderly couple who had never had a child, much as they prayed for one. It was considered shameful that Joachim had never fathered any offspring, and he felt the shame keenly. Anna was just as unhappy. One day she saw a nest of sparrows in a laurel tree, and wept that even the birds and the beasts could produce young, when she could not.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, however, possibly because of their fervent prayers, Anna conceived a child, and in due course she gave birth to a girl. Joachim and Anna vowed to dedicate her to the Lord God, so they took her to the temple and offered her to the high priest Zacharias, who kissed her and blessed her and took her into his care.<br>&nbsp;<br>Zacharias nurtured the child like a dove, and she danced for the Lord, and everyone loved her for her grace and simplicity.<br>&nbsp;<br>But she grew as every other girl did, and when she was twelve years old the priests of the temple realised that before long she would begin to bleed every month. That, of course, would pollute the holy place. What could they do? They had taken charge of her; they couldn&#x2019;t simply throw her out.<br>&nbsp;<br>So Zacharias prayed, and an angel told him what to do. They should find a husband for Mary, but he should be a good deal older, a steady and experienced man. A widower would be ideal. The angel gave precise instructions, and promised a miracle to confirm the choice of the right man.<br>&nbsp;<br>Accordingly, Zacharias called together as many widowers as he could find. Each one was to bring with him a wooden rod. A dozen or more men came in answer, some young, some middle-aged, some old. Among them was a carpenter called Joseph.<br>&nbsp;<br>Consulting his instructions, Zacharias gathered all the rods together and prayed over them before giving them back. The last to receive his rod was Joseph, and as soon as it came into his hand it burst into flower.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re the one!&#x2019; said Zacharias. &#x2018;The Lord has commanded that you should marry the girl Mary.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;But I&#x2019;m an old man!&#x2019; said Joseph. &#x2018;And I have sons older than the girl. I shall be a laughing-stock.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do as you are commanded,&#x2019; said Zacharias, &#x2018;or face the anger of the Lord. Remember what happened to Korah.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Korah was a Levite who had challenged the authority of Moses. As a punishment the earth opened under him and swallowed him up, together with all his household.<br>&nbsp;<br>Joseph was afraid, and reluctantly agreed to take the girl in marriage. He took her back to his house.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You must stay here while I go about my work,&#x2019; he told her. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll come back to you in good time. The Lord will watch over you.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>In Joseph&#x2019;s household Mary worked so hard and behaved so modestly that no one had a word of criticism for her. She spun wool, she made bread, she drew water from the well, and as she grew and became a young woman there were many who wondered at this strange marriage, and at Joseph&#x2019;s absence. There were others, too, young men in particular, who would try to speak to her and smile engagingly, but she said little in reply and kept her eyes on the ground. It was easy to see how simple and good she was.<br>&nbsp;<br>And time went past.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Union Street Bakery (A Union Street Bakery Novel)</h2><p><b>In the first novel of the Union Street Bakery series, Daisy McCrae learns how easily life can turn on a dime...</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Suddenly without a job or a boyfriend, Daisy now lives in the attic above her family&#x2019;s store, the Union Street Bakery, while she learns the business.

This expansion enriches and enlivens the book and the enjoyable task of finding details within each piece. Each spread features a three-quarter-page picture and a list of several things to look for. Cressy notes how studying a piece to find people, animals, and objects inevitably allows children to look at art closely and carefully. This exposure to international masterpieces representing different cultures and histories throughout the centuries is bound to make an impression on children. The paintings are stunning, and reproduced with attention to light and shadow; their diversity introduces readers to a wide variety of styles and subjects. Answers to the challenges are provided at the end of the book, along with information on each artist, the work itself, and where it resides.

The devotional dimension is evident in articles on Bible characters, which include sections on "Learning from the person's Life." Among the practical features is "A Reading and Study Guide" for books of the Bible, which summarizes each chapter and suggests related articles. The main alphabetical listings are supplemented by two sections that list biblical people and places (some of which are treated in the main listings) and a set of maps. The book maintains a relatively high degree of accuracy, although in areas where there is critical disagreement it comes down consistently on the conservative side.

Brought up by her father's black servants and white governesses, much of her time was spent riding and with the tame wild animals, including chimps and cheetahs, who lived on the estate. Although her mother was killed in a flying accident when she was three, Juanita did not discover this until, when she was six, a cousin taunted her with the truth. For this was the White Mischief era, when parents were busy partying and children lived their own hidden lives.<br>But children cannot hide for ever. There was school to attend in Europe and later South Africa, a different establishment each year, where she struggled to speak English instead of Swahili. At fifteen Juanita became involved in the Lord Erroll affair: she is the only person to whom Delves Broughton confessed to the murder of Lord Erroll.<br>This is Juanita's story: a colourful and passionate memoir, which reveals the darkness behind glittering White Mischief society.</p><p>Early twentieth-century British settlers in Kenya were a mixed lot. Many were pioneers out to make a life, but an equal number were scandalously debauched and in search of the free life they could neither afford nor live back in England. Born thus into the "Happy Valley Set" in 1925, Juanita Carberry from the outset felt all the confusion, anxiety, and loneliness of a child with indifferent, even hostile, parents. Her only relief as a child came from the land of Kenya, its native people and fascinating wildlife. Briony Sykes narrates the story of this difficult childhood partly with the petulant rhythms of the gifted though angry child, but more often with a voice alive with delight at the newness of Kenya unfolding all around her. Both tale and reading captivate us with the richness and fascination of this world that once was but, sadly, can be no more.

It is a device people use to avoid facing the fact that we are all solitary and perishable</i>. <br>Jacques Cousteau <br><br>Jacques Cousteau met Simone Melchior at her family's Paris apartment in the summer of 1936. She was seventeen, the daughter and granddaughter of French admirals, born on January 19, 1919, in Oran, Algeria. Until she was five years old, her family lived in Toulon, the home port of the Mediterranean fleet, then moved to Japan, where her father was a diplomatic attach�. By the time the Melchiors returned to France, Simone was a teenager fluent in Japanese and infected with wanderlust. Though her horizons were limited by her gender, she was a lyc�e student whose interests went far beyond keeping a house. She would later say that her dreams always included the sea. <br><br>The soir�e at which Cousteau met Simone was one of many hosted by Marguerite Melchior to introduce her daughter to eligible navy men. Cousteau was fixed on Simone from the moment he walked in the door. Feigning indifference, he registered a stunning, compact young woman with flaxen hair, high cheekbones, and a seductive m�lange of amusement and confidence in her alert green eyes. For her part, Simone quickly picked out the animated, wiry young man holding a movie camera of all things, not something she expected at one of her mother's parties. He was obviously navy, judging by his posture, but dressed in civilian clothes. She was instantly enchanted by his presence, a delightful blend of curiosity, delight, and confidence, and she liked the way he brashly panned his camera around the roomful of people holding cocktail glasses and chattering. He had a long, rural face, deeply etched by lines in his forehead pointing down to a long, sharp nose. Another set of concentric arcs wrinkled each side of his mouth, emphasizing a dazzling smile that he seemed to measure out for effect. As he wound the camera with its little silver handle, he moved his arms as though they hurt him. Simone's father easily noticed his daughter's interest in the officer with the camera, led him across the room to her, and introduced Ensign Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Admiral Melchior added that Cousteau was an aviation cadet living in Paris with his family while recuperating from injuries suffered in an automobile accident. <br><br>Cousteau took over the conversation, explaining the accident to Simone as though telling an adventure story in which he was simply a character swept along by events beyond his control. Five months earlier, he was just about to graduate from flight school when he borrowed his father's Salmson sports car to go to a friend's wedding in the hills west of Bordeaux, where he was based. The Salmson was fast and nimble, but when the headlights suddenly dimmed on a hairpin curve, he careered off the road into the darkness and blacked out. Only the luck of a farm truck on the otherwise deserted mountain road saved his life. Cousteau regained consciousness in the hospital with twelve broken bones and a paralyzed right arm. His doctor told him that his arm was numb because it was infected and probably should be amputated. Cousteau refused amputation. He would rather die than live as a one-armed man. A few days later, the infection resolved itself and his bones began to heal. After months of physical therapy, Cousteau was out of plaster and walking around, but he was in constant pain. He was finished as an aviator, and though he could not know it at the time he was again very lucky. Every man in his flying class would be killed during the first few weeks of the war with Germany that was three years away. <br><br>Cousteau, at twenty-six, was nine years older than Simone, and he had already sailed around the world&#x2014;with his camera&#x2014;on the training ship <i>Jeanne d'Arc</i>. Flying airplanes had been one of three possible life courses Cousteau had ceremoniously announced to his family as a boy. His other two choices were being a film director or becoming a medical doctor. Now, he was not at all sure of his future. Cousteau had been a curious but anxious boy who had become a man in love with impulse and driving fast cars on mountain roads. The rural face Simone had noticed right away was a true compass to his beginnings. He was born in St.-Andr�-de-Cubzac, an ancient village at the confluence of the Dordogne and Garonne rivers, which form the Gironde Estuary that flows into the Atlantic Ocean 100 kilometers to the northwest. The first traces of habitation of the fertile, temperate hillsides are shards and bone fragments more than ten thousand years old, evidence of seasonal encampments of nomadic bands foraging in the north after the last ice age. The Pax Romana had reached the Gironde two thousand years ago, creating the city now called Bordeaux with the profits from sugar, tobacco, indigo, cotton, ebony, cocoa, coffee, slaves, and oysters exported to the rest of the Roman Empire. When the wild oysters grew scarce, the Romans figured out how to raise them in sea farms from spat on discarded shells, a method still unchanged by time. Soon after they arrived, the Romans planted grapevines and made wine that would forever after define the place. The English took over Bordeaux in the twelfth century when Louis VII's divorced wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, married the Plantagenet king Henry II. Their kin ruled the region for three hundred years, as the wines of the magnificent, fertile valleys&#x2014;called Bordeaux by the French and claret by the English&#x2014;flowed by the shipload from convenient docks along the Gironde to London and the rest of the British Empire. <br><br>The vineyards nearest St.-Andr�-de-Cubzac are known for wines made from common grapes that are perfectly drinkable and preferred by locals because they aren't as expensive as the vintages of nearby St.-Emilion and Poulliac and the others that find their way into the cellars of oenophiles. Cousteau's mother, Elizabeth Duranthon, was one of five daughters in St.-Andr�-de-Cubzac's wealthiest family, descended from generations of landholders and wine merchants who had tended those vineyards as though bound to them by inherited vows. His father, Daniel, was a lawyer, one of five sons of the village <i>notaire</i> who was responsible for witnessing deeds, marriage contracts, and other consequential transactions. Daniel was the brightest of the Cousteau sons, so the family had marshaled its merchant-class resources to send him through law school in Paris. He returned to his home village of 3,800 as a fully fledged notaire himself, but remained for only three years, executing documents in his father's office and, not incidentally, courting Elizabeth. She agreed to marry him in the winter of 1905. The following spring, thirty-year-old Daniel and eighteen-year-old Elizabeth Cousteau boarded a train for the long day's journey to Paris; thereafter they rarely went back to St.-Andr�- de-Cubzac. <br><br>In Paris, Daniel Cousteau had only one client, an American expatriate his own age named James Hazen Hyde who had inherited a fortune from his father, the founder of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Hyde had fled the United States under a cloud of controversy and allegations that he had cooked the books of the insurance company after he took control. He sold out, moved to France, and lived royally, which included hiring Daniel as a legal adviser, traveling companion, private secretary, and tennis partner. Daniel was essentially a servant, though he was part of Hyde's inner social circle, and loved the life of leisure and pleasure. Daniel Cousteau and his wife were gilded vagabonds with no real home, but reckoned their life was a far better adventure than notarizing deeds in a quiet village or taking a minor position in her family's wine business. He was a man of only average intelligence who possessed finely tuned primitive instincts for simply getting things done. He had realized early in life that his wits and careful decisions were his only sources of real wealth, and he took advantage of opportunity as naturally as a fox snatches a chicken. Daniel was well aware that the only estate he would likely leave to whatever children he and Elizabeth might have was his example as a skillful liver of life. <br><br>Daniel and Elizabeth Cousteau's first son, Pierre-Antoine, was born in Paris in December 1906. A week later, Daniel headed south for the winter aboard James Hyde's yacht. Elizabeth returned to St.-Andr�-de- Cubzac to show off the baby to her family, after which she joined her husband and traveled with Hyde's entourage for four more years. Though the high life continued to appeal to the Cousteaus, the constant traveling and frequent separations took their toll on Elizabeth and Pierre. They had their own apartment in Paris but were rarely there. They returned home to the Gironde only for funerals and weddings. In the spring of 1910, Elizabeth was pregnant with her second child and the Cousteaus decided that she should return to St.-Andr� to have the baby with the help of her family. On June 10, 1910, the boy they named Jacques-Yves arrived in an upper bedroom of the Duranthon house across a courtyard from the village church. Though the Cousteaus were only nominally Catholic, Daniel returned to St.-Andr� for the baptism of their second son. <br><br>For three more years, the indulgences and adventures of James Hyde continued to determine the patterns of the Cousteau family. "My first conscious memory was of swaying in a hammock in a railroad coach as the train steamed through the night," Cousteau later said. "It was all okay until the war." <br><br>In September 1914, when Jacques-Yves was four years old, the German army reached the Marne on the outskirts of Paris. From there, the bloody western front extended along the river from Verdun to the English Channel. The French government retreated to Bordeaux, the lush life in Paris shriveled to one of subsistence, and James Hyde left Europe to lie low in America until things quieted down. He reluctantly let Daniel go in the wi...</p><h2>City of Splendors: Waterdeep (Forgotten Realms)</h2><p>The first in-depth look at Waterdeep, the shining jewel of the Forgotten Realms setting, in many years.<br>City of Splendors: Waterdeep offers an in-depth examination of the great city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten<br>Realms setting.

There was a time when Cicero held Caesar&#39;s life in the palm of his hand. But now Caesar is the dominant figure and Cicero&#39;s life is in ruins. Exiled, separated from his wife and children, his possessions confiscated, his life constantly in danger, Cicero is tormented by the knowledge that he has sacrificed power for the sake of his principles. His comeback requires wit, skill and courage - and for a brief and glorious period, the legendary orator is once more the supreme senator in Rome. But politics is never static and no statesman, however cunning, can safeguard against the ambition and corruption of others. Riveting and tumultuous, Dictator encompasses some of the most epic events in human history yet is also an intimate portrait of a brilliant, flawed, frequently fearful yet ultimately brave man - a hero for his time and for ours. This is an unforgettable tour de force from a master storyteller.</p><p><b>ROBERT HARRIS&nbsp;</b>is the author of nine best-selling novels:&nbsp;<i>Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, The Ghost Writer, Conspirata,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Fear Index,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>An Officer and a Spy</i>.

He lives in the village of Kintbury, England, with his wife, Gill Hornby.I<br><br>I remember the cries of caesar&#x2019;s war-horns chasing us over the darkened fields of Latium&#x2014;their yearning, keening howls, like animals in heat&#x2014;and how when they stopped there was only the slither of our shoes on the icy road and the urgent panting of our breath.<br><br>It was not enough for the immortal gods that Cicero should be spat at and reviled by his fellow citizens; not enough that in the middle of the night he be driven from the hearths and altars of his family and ancestors; not enough even that as we fled from Rome on foot he should look back and see his house in flames. To all these torments they deemed it necessary to add one further refinement: that he should be forced to hear his enemy&#x2019;s army striking camp on the Field of Mars.<br><br>Even though he was the oldest of our party Cicero kept up the same fast pace as the rest of us. Not long ago he had held Caesar&#x2019;s life in the palm of his hand. He could have crushed it as easily as an egg. Now their fortunes led them in entirely opposite directions. While Cicero hurried south to escape his enemies, the architect of his destruction marched north to take command of both provinces of Gaul.<br><br>He walked with his head down, not uttering a word and I imagined it was because he was too full of despair to speak. Only at dawn, when we rendezvoused with our horses at Bovillae and were about to embark on the second stage of our escape, did he pause with his foot in the doorway of his carriage and say suddenly, &#x201c;Do you think we should turn back?&#x201d;<br><br>The question caught me by surprise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t considered it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, consider it now. Tell me: why are we fleeing Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is Clodius so powerful?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s a tribune and can pass laws against you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who made it possible for him to become a tribune?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. &#x201c;Caesar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Caesar. Do you imagine that man&#x2019;s departure for Gaul at that precise hour was a coincidence? Of course not! He waited till his spies had reported I&#x2019;d left the city before ordering his army to move. Why? I&#x2019;d always assumed his advancement of Clodius was to punish me for speaking out against him. But what if his real aim all along was to drive me out of Rome? What scheme requires him to be certain I&#x2019;ve gone before he can leave too?&#x201d;<br><br>I should have grasped the logic of what he was saying. I should have urged him to turn back. But I was too exhausted to reason clearly. And if I am honest there was more to it than that. I was too afraid of what Clodius&#x2019;s thugs might do to us if they caught us re-entering the city.<br><br>So instead I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good question, and I can&#x2019;t pretend I have the answer. But wouldn&#x2019;t it look indecisive, after bidding goodbye to everyone, suddenly to reappear? In any case, Clodius has burned your house down now&#x2014;where would we return to? Who would take us in? I think you&#x2019;d be wiser to stick to your original plan and get as far away from Rome as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He rested his head against the side of the carriage and closed his eyes. In the pale grey light I was shocked by how haggard he appeared after his night on the road. His hair and beard had not been cut for weeks. He was wearing a toga dyed black. Although he was only in his forty-ninth year, these public signs of mourning made him look much older&#x2014;like some ancient, mendicant holy man. After a while he sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Tiro. Perhaps you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s so long since I slept I&#x2019;m too tired to think any more.&#x201d;<br><br>And so the fatal error was made&#x2014;more through indecision than decision&#x2014;and we continued to press on southwards for the remainder of that day and for the twelve days that followed, putting what we thought was a safe distance between ourselves and danger.<br><br>We travelled with a minimal entourage to avoid attracting attention&#x2014;just the carriage driver and three armed slaves on horseback, one in front and two behind. A small chest of gold and silver coins that Atticus, Cicero&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had provided to pay for our journey was hidden under our seat. We stayed only in the houses of men we trusted, no more than a night in each, and steered clear of those places where Cicero might have been expected to stop&#x2014;for example at his seaside villa at Formiae, the first place any pursuers would look for him, and along the Bay of Naples, already filling with the annual exodus from Rome in search of winter sun and warm springs. Instead we headed as fast as we could towards the toe of Italy.<br><br>Cicero&#x2019;s plan, conceived on the move, was to make for Sicily and stay there until the political agitation against him in Rome subsided. &#x201c;The mob will turn on Clodius eventually,&#x201d; he predicted. &#x201c;Such is the unalterable nature of the mob. He will always be my mortal enemy but he won&#x2019;t always be tribune&#x2014;we must never forget that. In nine months his term of office will expire and then we can go back.&#x201d;<br><br>He was confident of a friendly reception from the Sicilians, if only because of his successful prosecution of the island&#x2019;s tyrannical governor, Verres&#x2014;even though that brilliant victory, which launched his political career, was now twelve years in the past and Clodius had more recently been a magistrate in the province. I sent letters ahead giving notice of his intention to seek sanctuary, and when we reached the harbour at Regium we hired a little six-oared boat to row us across the straits to Messina.<br><br>We left the harbour on a clear cold winter morning of searing blues&#x2014;the sea and the sky; one light, one dark; the line dividing them as sharp as a blade; the distance to Messina a mere three miles. It took us less than an hour. We drew so close we could see Cicero&#x2019;s supporters lined up on the rocks to welcome him. But stationed between us and the entrance to the port was a warship flying the red and green colours of the governor of Sicily, Gaius Vergilius, and as we approached the lighthouse it slipped its anchor and moved slowly forwards to intercept us. Vergilius stood at the rail surrounded by his lictors and, after visibly recoiling at Cicero&#x2019;s dishevelled appearance, shouted down a greeting, to which Cicero replied in friendly terms. They had known one another in the Senate for many years.<br><br>Vergilius asked him his intentions.<br><br>Cicero called back that naturally he intended to come ashore.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d heard,&#x201d; replied Vergilius. &#x201c;Unhappily I can&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius&#x2019;s new law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what new law would that be? There are so many, one loses count.&#x201d;<br><br>Vergilius beckoned to a member of his staff who produced a document and leaned down to pass it to me and I then gave it to Cicero. To this day I can remember how it fluttered in his hands in the slight breeze as if it were a living thing; it was the only sound in the silence. He took his time and when he had finished reading it he handed it to me without comment.<br><br>Lex Clodia in Ciceronem<br><br>Whereas M. T. Cicero has put Roman citizens to death unheard and uncondemned; and to that end forged the authority and decree of the Senate; it is hereby ordained that he be interdicted from fire and water to a distance of four hundred miles from Rome; that nobody should presume to harbour or receive him, on pain of death; that all his property and possessions be forfeit; that his house in Rome be demolished and a shrine to Liberty consecrated in its place; and that whoever shall move, speak, vote or take any step towards recalling him shall be treated as a public enemy, unless those whom Cicero unlawfully put to death should first spring back to life.<br><br>It must have been the most terrible blow. But he found the composure to dismiss it with a flick of his hand. &#x201c;When,&#x201d; he enquired, &#x201c;was this nonsense published?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told it was posted in Rome eight days ago. It came into my hands yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s not law yet, and can&#x2019;t be law until it&#x2019;s been read a third time. My secretary will confirm it. Tiro,&#x201d; he said, turning to me, &#x201c;tell the governor the earliest date it can be passed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to calculate. Before a bill could be put to a vote it had to be read aloud in the Forum on three successive market days. But my reasoning was so shaken by what I had just read I couldn&#x2019;t remember what day of the week it was now, let alone when the market days fell. &#x201c;Twenty days from today,&#x201d; I hazarded, &#x201c;perhaps twenty-five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; cried Cicero. &#x201c;I have three weeks&#x2019; grace even if it passes, which I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He stood up in the prow of the boat, bracing his legs against the rocking of the hull, and spread his arms wide in appeal. &#x201c;Please, my dear Vergilius, for the sake of our past friendship, now that I have come so far, at least allow me to land and spend a night or two with my supporters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, as I say, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I cannot take the risk. I&#x2019;ve consulted my experts. They say even if you travelled to the very western tip of the island, to Lilybaeum, you&#x2019;d still be within three hundred and fifty miles of Rome, and then Clodius would come after me.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Cicero ceased to be so friendly. He said coldly, &#x201c;You have no right under the law to impede the journey of a Roman citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have every right to safeguard the tranquillity of my province. And here, as you know, my word is the law . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He was apologetic. I dare say he was even embarrassed. But he was immovable, and after a few more angry exchanges there was nothing for it but to turn round and row back to Regium. Our departure provoked a great cry of dismay from the shoreline and I could see that Cicero for the first time was seriously worried. Vergilius was a friend of his. If this was how a friend reacted then soon the whole of Italy would be closed against him. Returning to Rome to oppose the law was much too risky. He had left it too late. Apart from the physical danger such a journey would entail, the bill would almost certainly pass, and then we would be stranded four hundred miles from the legal limit it prescribed. To comply safely with the terms of his exile he would have to flee abroad immediately. Obviously Gaul was out of the question because of Caesar. So it would have to be somewhere in the East&#x2014;Greece perhaps, or Asia. But unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the peninsula to make our escape in the treacherous winter seas. We needed to get over to the opposite coast, to Brundisium on the Adriatic, and find a big ship capable of making a lengthy voyage. Our predicament was exquisitely vile&#x2014;as no doubt Caesar, the original sponsor and creator of Clodius, had intended.<br><br>it took us two weeks of arduous travel to cross the mountains, often in heavy rain and mostly along bad roads. Every mile seemed fraught with the hazard of ambush, although the primi�tive little towns we passed through were welcoming enough. At night we slept in smoky, freezing inns and dined on hard bread and fatty meat made scarcely more palatable by sour wine. Cicero&#x2019;s mood veered between fury and despair. He saw clearly now that he had made a terrible mistake by leaving Rome. It had been madness for him to quit the city and leave Clodius free to spread the calumny that he had put citizens to death &#x201c;unheard and uncondemned&#x201d; when in fact each of the five Catiline conspirators had been allowed to speak in his own defence and their execution had been sanctioned by the entire Senate. But his flight was tantamount to an admission of guilt. He should have obeyed his instinct and turned back when he heard Caesar&#x2019;s departing trumpets and first began to realise his error. He wept at the disaster his folly and timidity had brought upon his wife and children.<br><br>And when he had finished lashing himself, he turned his scourge on Hortensius &#x201c;and the rest of the aristocratic gang,&#x201d; who had never forgiven him for rising from his humble origins to the consulship and saving the republic: they had deliberately urged him to flee in order to ruin him. He should have heeded the example of Socrates, who said that death was preferable to exile. Yes, he should have killed himself! He snatched up a knife from the dining table. He would kill himself! I said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t take the threat seriously. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the sight of others&#x2019; blood, let alone his own. All his life he had tried to avoid military expeditions, the games, public executions, funerals&#x2014;anything that might remind him of mortality. If pain frightened him, death terrified him&#x2014;which, although I would never have been impertinent enough to point it out, was the principal reason we had fled Rome in the first place.<br><br>When finally we came within sight of the fortified walls of Brundisium, he decided not to venture inside. The port was so large and busy, so full of strangers, and so likely to be his desti�n�ation, he was convinced it was the obvious spot for his assassination. Instead we sought sanctuary a little way up the coast, in the residence of his old friend Marcus Laenius Flaccus. That night we slept in decent beds for the first time in three weeks, and the next morning we went down to the beach. The waves were much rougher than on the Sicilian side. A strong wind was hurling the Adriatic relentlessly against the rocks and shingle. Cicero loathed sea voyages at the best of times; this one promised to be especially treacherous. Yet it was our only means of escape. One hundred and twenty miles beyond the horizon lay the shore of Illyricum.<br><br>Flaccus, noticing his expression, said, &#x201c;Fortify your spirits, Cicero&#x2014;perhaps the bill won&#x2019;t pass, or one of the other tribunes will veto it. There must be someone left in Rome willing to stand up for you&#x2014;Pompey, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cicero, his gaze still fixed out to sea, made no reply, and a few days later we heard that the bill had indeed become law and that Flaccus was therefore guilty of a capital offence simply by having a convicted exile on his premises. Even so he tried to persuade us to stay. He insisted that Clodius didn&#x2019;t frighten him. But Cicero wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it: &#x201c;Your loyalty moves me, old friend, but that monster will have dispatched a team of his hired fighters to hunt me down the moment his law passed. There is no time to lose.&#x201d;<br><br>I had found a merchant ship in the harbour at Brundisium whose hard-pressed master was willing to risk a winter voyage across the Adriatic in return for a huge fee, and the next morning at first light, when no one was around, we went on board. She was a sturdy, broad-beamed vessel, with a crew of about twenty, used to ply the trade route between Italy and Dyrrachium. I was no judge of these things, but she looked safe enough to me. The master estimated the crossing would require a day and a half&#x2014;but we needed to leave quickly, he said, and take advantage of the favourable wind. So while the sailors made her ready and Flaccus waited on the quayside, Cicero quickly dictated a final message to his wife and children: It has been a fine life, a great career&#x2014;the good in me, nothing bad, has brought me down. My dear Terentia, loyalest and best of wives, my darling daughter Tullia, and little Marcus, our one remaining hope&#x2014;goodbye! I copied it out and passed it up to Flaccus. He raised his hand in farewell. Then the sail was unfurled, the cables cast off, the oarsmen pushed us away from the harbour wall, and we set off into the pale grey light.<br><br>at first we made good speed. cicero stood high above the deck on the steersmen&#x2019;s platform, leaning on the stern rail, watching the great lighthouse of Brundisium recede behind us. Apart from his visits to Sicily, it was the first time he had left Italy since his youth, when he went to Rhodes to learn oratory from Molon. Of all the men I ever knew, Cicero was the least equipped by temperament for exile. To thrive he needed the appurtenances of civilised society&#x2014;friends, news...</p><h2>Worldliness: Resisting the Seduction of a Fallen World</h2><p><p>This resource uncovers the presence of worldliness and helps believers learn to relate to the world while resisting its influence in their lives.</p> <p>People today are saturated in technology and prosperity. They are bombarded with endless luxuries: clothes to wear, cars to buy, vacations to take, entertainment to enjoy.

In these pages you find a valiant attempt at promoting holiness and combating worldliness without falling into these traps. Most of the focus is on the subtlety of individual temptations and sins rather than on the equally subtle temptations to large-scale social evils. But the strength of the work is that the authors try very hard not to let you forget the sheer God-centeredness of the gospel, the glory of the cross of Christ. We will best combat worldliness when we are most drawn to Christ. But that spectacularly wonderful truth does not mean there are no wise barriers to erect and no judgment calls to be made, such that we find ourselves pursuing excellence and refusing to be satisfied with mediocrity.

Carson</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;research professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>"In the word worldliness is contained one of the great problems of evangelical Christianity in our time. Here in the West, in the English-speaking world, churches and Christians have been seriously compromised by worldliness. This danger and diagnosis is critical for us to understand. In worldliness, our mind, will and affections, our thinking, living and desiring become captive to a lesser joy than the real and true joy that is only found in treasuring God and His glory in Jesus Christ. Worldliness is thus soul-destroying and joy-robbing because it tricks our hearts into seeking satisfaction in what can never satisfy and thus slowly strangles us of the experience of being fully alive to God. That's why John Newton (who knew this from experience) wrote in one of his great hymns: 'Fading is the worldling's pleasure, all his boasted pomp and show; Solid joys and lasting treasure none but Zion's children know.' Because this spiritual malady is one of epic proportions, because it is destroying churches and Christians on every side, because it stalks me and my own congregation, I am deeply grateful that my dear friend C.J. Mahaney (along with Dave Harvey, Bob Kauflin, Jeff Purswell and Craig Cabaniss) has tackled this vital pastoral issue. These wise shepherds have a way of getting to your heart in this book (I know this because in reading it, they got to mine). And in Christianity, as J.C. Ryle liked to say, 'The heart of the matter is the matter of the heart.' These skillful soul-surgeons are brilliant at diagnosis and treatment, and will help you see yourself, see your sin and see your Savior. I now know that first book I am going to reach for when a Christian is wrestling with worldliness, or isn't but should be! The questions they offer for self-examination are, in and of themselves, of strategic value in our fight of faith for joy.

But in the long, hot summer of his seventh year, two groups of migrant workers &#x2014; and two very dangerous men &#x2014; came through the Arkansas Delta to work the Chandler cotton farm. And suddenly mysteries are flooding Luke&#x2019;s world.<br><br>A brutal murder leaves the town seething in gossip and suspicion. A beautiful young woman ignites forbidden passions. A fatherless baby is born ... and someone has begun furtively painting the bare clapboards of the Chandler farmhouse, slowly, painstakingly, bathing the run-down structure in gleaming white. And as young Luke watches the world around him, he unravels secrets that could shatter lives &#x2014; and change his family and his town forever....<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Ever since he published <i>The Firm</i> in 1991, John Grisham has remained the undisputed champ of the legal thriller. With <i>A Painted House</i>, however, he strikes out in a new direction. As the author is quick to note, this novel includes "not a single lawyer, dead or alive," and readers will search in vain for the kind of lowlife machinations that have been his stock-in-trade. Instead, Grisham has delivered a quieter, more contemplative story, set in rural Arkansas in 1952. It's harvest time on the Chandler farm, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and "hill people" to pick 80 acres of cotton. A certain camaraderie pervades this bucolic dream team. But it's backbreaking work, particularly for the 7-year-old narrator, Luke: "I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice."<p> What's more, tensions begin to simmer between the Mexicans and the hill people, one of whom has a penchant for bare-knuckles brawling. This leads to a brutal murder, which young Luke has the bad luck to witness. At this point--with secrets, lies, and at least one knife fight in the offing--the plot begins to take on that familiar, Grisham-style momentum. Still, such matters ultimately take a back seat in <i>A Painted House</i> to the author's evocation of time and place. This is, after all, the scene of his boyhood, and Grisham waxes nostalgic without ever succumbing to deep-fried sentimentality. Meanwhile, his account of Luke's Baptist upbringing occasions some sly (and telling) humor: </p><blockquote> I'd been taught in Sunday school from the day I could walk that lying would send you straight to hell. No detours. No second chances. Straight into the fiery pit, where Satan was waiting with the likes of Hitler and Judas Iscariot and General Grant. Thou shalt not bear false witness, which, of course, didn't sound exactly like a strict prohibition against lying, but that was the way the Baptists interpreted it. </blockquote> Whether Grisham will continue along these lines, or revert to the judicial shark tank for his next book, is anybody's guess. But <i>A Painted House</i> suggests that he's perfectly capable of telling an involving story with nary a subpoena in sight. <i>--James Marcus</i>Dear Friends: <p><i>A Painted House</i> is not a legal thriller. In fact, there is not a single lawyer, dead or alive, in this story. Nor are there judges, trials, courtrooms, conspiracies or nagging social issues. </p><p><i>A Painted House</i> is a work of fiction. It was inspired by my childhood in rural Arkansas. The setting is reasonably accurate, though historical accuracy should not be taken too seriously. One or two of these characters may actually have lived and breathed on this earth, though I know them only through family lore, which in my family is a most unreliable source. One or two of these events may indeed have taken place, though I've heard so many different versions of these events that I believe none of them myself. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>John Grisham</p></p><h2>Old House of Fear</h2><p>Attorney Hugh Logan leaves Canada for Scotland to negotiate the purchase of Carnglass Island and the castle Old House of Fear for his employer, Duncan MacAskival.

In 1991, in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, an Hasidic man&#39;s car jumped a curb, killing Gavin Cato, a seven-year-old black child. Later, in what appears to have been an act of retaliation on the part of a faction of the black community, Yankel Rosenbaum, an Hasidic rabbinical student, was stabbed and killed. The ensuing riots that wracked Crown Heights&#39; previous atmosphere of tolerance for its divergent cultures made national headlines and pointed to the growing friction in racial and cultural relations across America. Drawing verbatim from a series of over fifty interviews with Crown Heights&#39; residents, politicians, activists, religious leaders, gangs, street dwellers, victims and perpetrators alike, Anna Deavere Smith has created a theatrical event distilling the lives and voices of twenty-six of the incident&#39;s survivors into a visionary amalgam, the import of which touches upon every A</p><p>Derived from interviews with a wide range of people who experienced or observed New York's 1991 Crown Heights racial riots, <i>Fires In The Mirror</i> is as distinguished a work of commentary on current Black-White tensions as it is a work of drama.<b>Anna Deavere Smith</b> is an actor, a teacher, a playwright, and the creator of an acclaimed series of one-woman plays based on her interviews with diverse voices from communities in crisis.

The genesis for The Force of Reason was a postscript entitled Due Anni Dopo (Two Years Later), which was intended as a brief appendix to the thirtieth edition of The Rage and the Pride (2002). Once Ms. Fallaci completed the postscript, she chose to expand it into a book, a continuation of her ideas set in motion in The Rage and the Pride.In The Force of Reason Fallaci takes aim at the many attacks and death threats she received after the publication of The Rage and the Pride. Ms. Fallaci begins by identifying herself with one Master Cecco, the author of a heretical book who was burnt at the stake during the Inquisition seven centuries ago on account of his beliefs, and proceeds with a rigorous analysis of the burning of Troy and the creation of a Europe that, to her judgment, is no longer her familiar homeland but rather a place best called Eurabia, a soon-to-be colony of Islam (with Italy as its stronghold). Ms. Fallaci explores her ideas in historical, philosophical, moral, and political terms, courageously addressing taboo topics with sharp logic.</p><p>As a war correspondent Oriana Fallaci has covered the great majority of our era&#39;s conflicts: from Vietnam to the Middle East; from the 1965 Hungarian insurrection to the 1970s Latin American upheavals; and from the 1968 massacre in Mexico City, where she was seriously wounded, to the Gulf War. Her books, which include popular novels, have been translated into twenty-one languages.</p><h2>Choosing Against War: A Christian View</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a leading writer and thinker. How might Christians look on the world differently if they actually believed that God's love is indeed stronger than our fears? In fresh, confessional language, Roth shares his convictions about Christian pacifism, inviting others to consider this approach, all the while humbly admitting the difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of violence, are there any options open to the Christian believer other than the "default" impulse toward patriotic unity and a steely determination to exact "an eye for an eye"? A must-read for anyone concerned about the endless cycles of wars and violence, and the possibility that God's love is stronger than our society's current answers.</p><p>A new book by a leading writer and thinker.

Beginning with the first written account of the island, penned by Christopher Columbus in 1492, the selections assembled here track Cuban history from the colonial period through the ascendancy of Fidel Castro to the present.<p></p><p><i>The Cuba Reader</i> combines songs, paintings, photographs, poems, short stories, speeches, cartoons, government reports and proclamations, and pieces by historians, journalists, and others. Most of these are by Cubans, and many appear for the first time in English. The writings and speeches of Jos� Mart�, Fernando Ortiz, Fidel Castro, Alejo Carpentier, Che Guevera, and Reinaldo Arenas appear alongside the testimonies of slaves, prostitutes, doctors, travelers, and activists. Some selections examine health, education, Catholicism, and santer�a; others celebrate Cuba&#x2019;s vibrant dance, music, film, and literary cultures. The pieces are grouped into chronological sections. Each section and individual selection is preceded by a brief introduction by the editors.</p><p>The volume presents a number of pieces about twentieth-century Cuba, including the events leading up to and following Castro&#x2019;s January 1959 announcement of revolution. It provides a look at Cuba in relation to the rest of the world: the effect of its revolution on Latin America and the Caribbean, its alliance with the Soviet Union from the 1960s until the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989, and its tumultuous relationship with the United States. <i>The Cuba Reader</i> also describes life in the <i>periodo especial</i> following the cutoff of Soviet aid and the tightening of the U.S. embargo. </p><p>For students, travelers, and all those who want to know more about the island nation just ninety miles south of Florida, <i>The Cuba Reader </i>is an invaluable introduction.</p></p><p>&#34;[An] ambitious and impressive anthology, a sweeping collection of source materials by and about Cubans both on the island and living in other countries.&#34;--Susan Fernandez, The Miami Herald&#34;&#34;The Cuba Reader&#34; offers a splendid overview of the Cuban experience, past and present, through a dazzling array of points of view. The voices of participants and observers and perspectives on the extraordinary and the commonplace--with imagery conveyed by way of photography and poetry, through the lyric of music and the nuance of the novel--make for a compelling collection of material.

Don Gibson challenges the conventional wisdom and asserts, with powerful support from Kennedy&#x2019;s own words and actions -- and those of his enemies -- that Kennedy was always on the side of economic, political and social progress. To achieve his goals of government for the people, JFK crossed swords courageously and vigorously with the real centers of power. They punished him with the ultimate sacrifice -- his own life, and fifty years of crushing defeats of our American ideals. In this intriguing and penetrating analysis, Gibson looks at what JFK himself said, wrote, and did, contrasting that with the words and actions of his enemies -- the <i>Wall Street Journal, Fortune </i> magazine, and the corporate and banking magnates themselves, who, as this book shows, truly despised the President. Conventional wisdom depicts Kennedy as a cautious president committed to the status quo and to the Establishment. This book makes a compelling case to the contrary, showing that President Kennedy was always willing to do battle for his progressive policies, even in the face of vicious attacks. With its clear and lively style, this book is a revelation to the general reader and to the specialist, opening the way to a new understanding of the meaning of Kennedy&#x2019;s legacy. This new edition includes a tribute to Robert F. Kennedy, who followed in his brother's footsteps, and made the same supreme sacrifice for the ideals they shared. RFK courageously carried forward the activist struggle, against oligarchy and for a better world: for dignity, equality, justice and progress for all people and nations. Fifty years ago, on June 6, 1968, he was cut down before he could take office, after winning the primary elections for president.</p><p>Professor Gibson&#x2019;s research on social power and on U.S. economic problems led him to writing on the administration of John F. Kennedy and related topics around the struggle between economic democracy and elitist oligarchy. Donald Gibson is a Professor of Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh. He received his PhD from the University of Delaware and taught there and at Middlebury and Oberlin Colleges. Don was born and raised in the Philadelphia area. He served as a communications analyst in the United States Air Force during the 1960s. He is also the author of four other books: <i>The Kennedy Assassination Cover-up; Environmentalism: Ideology and Power; Communication, Power and the Media; and Wealth, Power, and The Crisis of Laissez Faire Capitalism.</i></p><h2>First Year Healthy</h2><p><p><b>A mysterious, unsettling parable from one of North America's most popular cartoonists</b><br><b></b><i></i><br><i>First Year Healthy</i> purports to be the story of a young woman, recently released from the hospital after an outburst, and her burgeoning relationship with an odd, perhaps criminal Turkish immigrant.

With almost 800 well-tested recipes by <i>Times</i> food writers, this collection includes influences from Northern Africa, Western and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. It is a collection to cook from as well as to celebrate the history, culture, culinary creativity, and enduring tradition of Jews around the world. </p><p>Mimi Sheraton, food critic and cookbook author, has written a full introduction to the book as well as to each chapter, providing context and expertise to entertain and inspire. Editor Linda Amster has organized chapters to cover every course: appetizers, breads, soups, fish, meat, chicken, vegetables and salads, grains and dairy delights, cakes, cookies, and other desserts. Delicious recipes include both traditional favorites and more recent variations that update the classics with a contemporary twist. All recipes are kosher and include dishes from dozens of well-known writers and chefs such as, Ms. Sheraton, Alain Ducasse, Joan Nathan, Daniel Boulud, and Wolfgang Puck.</p><p>This useful, appealing, and imaginative volume will delight those who celebrate Jewish culinary culture, and is sure to set a new standard on the Jewish cookbook shelf.</p></p><p><p><b>Linda Amster</b> is manager of news research at <i>The New York </i><i>Times</i> and the editor of <i>The New York Times Passover Cookbook</i>.</p><p><b>Mimi Sharaton</b> is one of the country's best known food writers and experts on Jewish cooking. She is the author of several successful food books, including <i>From My Mother's Kitchen</i> and, most recently, <i>The Bialy Eaters: The Story of a Bread and a Lost World</i>. She is also a former restaurant critic of <i>The New York Times</i>, where her articles on food appear frequently.</p>Despite coming from the prolific New York Times stable of books, this volume may prove a disappointment to those with some knowledge of Jewish cuisine. Sheraton's introduction points out that "Jewish food is the world's oldest fusion cuisine," but the book appears to apply a thin definition of what makes each dish Jewish. With such a vast number of recipes, time-honored dishes are well represented, including the ubiquitous Classical Gefilte Fish, Kasha Varnishkas and Cholent Brisket, although the latter is not fully represented compared to the numerous tagines included. While drawing on many traditional dishes that will be immediately recognized by Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews, many recipes rely on just one or two ingredients for their Jewishness, such as chickpeas in the Warm Chickpeas with Lemon and Olives or honey in David Bouley's Fava Beans with Honey, Lime and Thyme. Despite the lack of clarification for their inclusion, the sheer volume of recipes means that there is something for everyone-from the more traditional to something modern to expand the repertoire. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Books: Arms and Armor</h2><p>A photo essay examining the design, construction, and uses of hand weapons and armor from a Stone Age axe to the revolvers and rifles of the Wild West.</p><p>In a world where even toy guns are reviled by pacifistic parents there exists the extraordinary Eyewitness Book <i>Arms &amp; Armor</i>. Studying weaponry is an unusual, fascinating angle on human history, as people have always used weapons to hunt, defend themselves, or attack. This intriguing photo essay examines the design, construction, and use of hand weapons and armor--from the Stone Age axe to the revolvers and rifles of the Wild West. <p> In the tradition of the <i>Eyewitness</i> series, <i>Arms &amp; Armor</i> begins with a short introduction to prehistoric weapons, accompanied by a photograph-rich spread with fascinating, history-packed, fun-fact-loaded captions. <i>The Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> says the Eyewitness Books are "like a mini-museum between the covers of a book," and they are right! From crude Paleolithic hand axes, we progress to missile weapons; the first warriors (and the effect of the discovery of copper and bronze on tools and weapons); the weapons of the armies of ancient times; weapons from the Dark Ages; European swords; crossbows versus longbows; axes, daggers, and knives; plate and mail armor; Indian warriors; Japanese samurais; early firearms; flintlock firearms; dueling swords; dueling pistols ("Although illegal, for centuries dueling was a popular way for 'gentlemen' and army officers to settle their quarrels," the section begins); bizarre, extraordinary, seemingly impractical hand weapons; grenadiers and cavalry; pistols; "Guns that won the West"; North American Indian weapons; and, believe it or not, more. This book is sure to find an audience with youngsters obsessed with knights and times medieval, art-history buffs, amateur historians, or anyone with a penchant for pistols. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Full-color photos. "An eye grabber: large, clear photographic layouts of weapons share pages with explanatory text and definitive illustrations. Each double spread covers a subject, from primitive weapons to the 'Guns That Won the West'; it's easy to forget their function in the beauty of the pieces and their clever designs. The weapons from the Middle Ages are breathtaking simply as art. A plum pudding of a book."--<i>Kirkus. </i></p><h2>Blood on the Border : A Memoir of the Contra War</h2><p><p>With <i>Blood on the Border: A Memoir of the Contra War</i>, Dunbar-Ortiz presents the third volume in her critically acclaimed memoir. In this long-awaited book, she vividly recounts on-the-ground memories of the contra war in Nicaragua, chronicling the US-sponsored terror inflicted on the people of Nicaragua following their 1981 election of the socialist Sandinistas, ousting Reagan darling and vicious dictator Somoza.</p><p>The war&#x2019;s opening salvo was the bombing of a Nicaraguan plane in Mexico City by US-backed contras, the plane Dunbar-Ortiz would have been on were it not for a delay. This disarming closeness to the fraught history of the US/Nicaraguan relationship shapes Dunbar-Ortiz&#x2019;s narrative, bringing uncomfortably present the decade-long dirty war that the Reagan administration pursued in Nicaragua against civilian and soldier alike.</p><p>As with her first two memoirs, in <i>Blood on the Border</i>, Dunbar-Ortiz seamlessly connects the dots not only between the personal and the political, but between recent history and our present moment. Unlike the many commentators who view the September 11, 2001, attacks as the start of the so-called &#x201c;war on terror,&#x201d; Dunbar-Ortiz offers firsthand testimony on battles waged much earlier. While her rich political analysis of this history bears the mark of a trained historian, she also writes from her perspective as an intrepid activist who spent months at a time throughout the 1980s in the war-torn country, especially in the remote Mosquitia region, where the indigenous Miskitu people were viciously assailed and nearly wiped out by CIA-trained contra mercenaries. She makes painfully clear the connections between what many US Americans only remember vaguely as the Iran-Contra &#x201c;affair&#x201d; and current US aggression in the Americas, the Middle East, and around the world. Clearly, this will be a book valuable not only for students of Latin American history, but also for anyone who is interested in better understanding the violent turmoil of our world today.</p></p><p>Unlike the many commentators who view the September 11, 2001 attacks as the start of the "War on Terror," in Blood on the Border legendary human rights activist and historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers firsthand testimony on battles waged much earlier.

Embargoed in the U.S. &amp; twelve other countries. Machtan (modern and current history, Bremen U., Germany) contends that not only can it be conclusively proven that Adolf Hitler was homosexual, but that this is a historical fact that is, if not the key, central to any reinterpretation of the character of the high command of the Nazi regime. He suggests that earlier consideration of this possibility has been precluded by a post-war taboo, related to both homosexuality and to a dismissal of personal information as irrelevant to historical inquiry. Central to the argument is the case of Ernst Rohm, who had been left the leadership of the Nazis in the early 1920s, only to be recalled by Hitler and later killed on Hitler's orders as allegations of Rohm's sexuality began to surface. This incident and the Nazi's vicious campaign against homosexuals both represent, according to Machtan, Hitler's efforts to protect his political legitimacy against allegations regarding his own sexuality.</p><p></p><h2>Combat Handbook (Minecraft)</h2><p>In Minecraft, you&#39;re never alone and the threat of attack is constant.

He is co-producer of the 5-CD Smithsonian set <i>The Jazz Singers</i>, nominated for a Grammy award. His articles on American music and literature appear in the <i>New York Times</i>, the<i> Washington Post</i>, and the<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.Narcotics, jail, sexual abuse, and prejudice are often our first associations concerning the life of the great jazz singer, but this biography recalls only Holiday as artist. O'Meally (English, Barnard Coll.) puts her tragedy and talent into perspective, and what emerges is a critique of a singer. The book's first section is outstanding in this regard, employing stories, quotes, and interviews in describing Holiday's technique. Holiday and William Dufty's Lady Sings the Blues ( LJ 8/56) is a serious and inspirational account; O'Meally's treatment is also serious, but he offers psychological analysis as well. Referring to the subtitle, O'Meally writes, "Through her music . . . she faced down a world full of trouble . . . her songs were confrontations." No index or footnotes are provided, but there is a large selected bibliography. For large public libraries and academic music collections. (Photos not seen).<br><i>- Ina M.

Indeed the settlers, who probably didn't think of themselves as Pilgrims and were most certainly not revolutionaries against their king, were lucky not to be wiped out during their first winter. They probably would have been had the local Indian population not been affected even worse by disease and starvation.<p> In this fascinating history of America's favorite creation myth, peppered with delightful and unexpected insights, Godfrey Hodgson throws new light on the radicalism of the so-called Pilgrims, the financing of their trip, the state of the Indian tribes that they encountered when they landed and the reasons why Plymouth probably didn't have a rock.</p></p><p><b>Godfrey Hodgson</b> is currently a visiting journalism professor at the City University in London, and has just retired as director of the Reuters Foundation Programme at Oxford University, where for eight years he was a Fellow of Green College. He is the author of four previous books.After reading this book, readers may finally fully understand the meaning of Thanksgiving as the Pilgrims first intended. Beginning with the religious movements in 17th century Europe, Hodgson gives a fastidiously researched description of the path that leads the Pilgrims to the new world to preach their godly message. Contrary to 19th century prints, Hodgson describes the Pilgrims at their first landing, not "with fife and drum, watched by cowering Indians, but staggering ashore, exhausted, drenched, and chilled to the bone." Establishing the colony was a brutal exercise. The Pilgrims endured "the starving time," and had to secretly bury bodies "so the Indians should not suspect how much the settlement was weakened." Hodgson follows the evolution of Thanksgiving into contemporary times, chronicling the rise of football as a Thanksgiving tradition, "almost as sacred as turkey and cranberry sauce, or pumpkin pie." At times Hodgson's attention to detail slows down the narrative, but balances it out with the tale on the high seas and the patriotism of the colonists. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Friedman investigates how women patrons of architecture were essential catalysts for innovation in domestic architectural design. By looking at such iconic houses as Hollyhock House (Frank Lloyd Wright), the Truus Schröder House (Gerrit Rietveld), the Edith Farnsworth House (Ludwig Mies van der Rohe), the Constance Perkins House (Richard Neutra), and the Vanna Venturi House (Robert Venturi), she explores the challenges that unconventional attitudes and ways of life presented to architectural thinking and to the architects themselves. Detailed portraits fashioned from personal letters, diaries, office records, photo albums, and interviews of the clients and architects reveal the private passions and struggles that women and men of talent and creativity brought to these projects, and suggest the rich cultural and artistic context in which each house was created. The works considered are thus brought to life through the people who commissioned, designed, and lived in them.</p><p>Social and architectural historian Alice T. Friedman asks the question, "Why is it that an unexpectedly large number of the most significant and original houses built in Europe and America in the 20th century--houses that stand out not only as examples of modern design but also for their innovative approaches to domestic space--were commissioned by female clients?" She answers with a penetrating look at houses created by well-known client-architect pairs, such as Sarah Stein and Le Corbusier, Edith Farnsworth and Mies van der Rohe, and more than one independent woman who irritated Frank Lloyd Wright by staying in charge of a project. Friedman writes with brilliance and depth about these pairs' shared ideals, their frequent disputes, and the monuments of modernism that resulted from their complex relationships. <i>--Margaret Moorman</i><b>Alice T.

Cherry-Garrard was the youngest member of the ill-fated 1912 expedition of Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole, and he later wrote this authoritative account of Scotts race against the Norwegian, Roald Amundsen, to be the first to reach the Pole, and of its disastrous outcome. <p>Original publication date 1922<br> New introduction by Karl E. Meyer<br> Photos by expedition member Herbert Ponting<br> New maps</p></p><p>As Apsley Cherry-Garrard states in his introduction to the harrowing story of the Scott expedition to the South Pole, "Polar Exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised." Cherry-Garrard's <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i> is a gripping account of an expedition gone disastrously wrong. The youngest member of Scott's team, the author was later part of the rescue party that eventually found the frozen bodies of Scott and three men who had accompanied Scott on the final push to the Pole. These deaths would haunt Cherry-Garrard for the rest of his life as he questioned the decisions he had made and the actions he had taken in the days leading up to the Polar Party's demise. <p>Prior to this sad denouement, Cherry-Garrard's account is filled with details of scientific discovery and anecdotes of human resilience in a harsh environment. Each participant in the Scott expedition is brought fully to life. Cherry-Garrard's recollections are supported by diary excerpts and accounts from other teammates. Despite the sad fate of Scott, the reader will grudgingly agree with the closing words of <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i>: "Exploration is the physical expression of the Intellectual Passion. And I tell you, if you have the desire for knowledge and the power to give it physical expression, go out and explore.... If you march your Winter Journeys you will have your reward, so long as all you want is a penguin's egg."</p>"Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time that has ever been devised" wrote Apsley Cherry-Garrard in a deceptively jaunty introduction to this classic story of bravery and fortitude first published in 1922. The story he relates is of Scott's last expedition to the Antarctic. From its departure from England in 1910 to its arrival in New Zealand in 1913, it is one of the most famous and tragic in the annals of exploration. Driven by an obsession for scientific knowledge, these brave polar explorers embarked on a journey into the unknown, testing their endurance by pushing themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they surveyed the striking and mammoth land that lay far to the south.<br>Cherry-Garrard was himself a member of the expedition that had two goals: to discover as much as was scientifically possible about the terrain and habitat of Antarctica, and to be the first to reach the South Pole. The party was plagued by bad luck, weather conditions of unanticipated ferocity, and the physical deterioration of the party on the last part of the journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole a month before them, Scott's party then had to negotiate the last, heroic part of their journey, a doomed attempt which has entered modern mythology.<br>The Worst Journey in the World is the inside story of this most famous of journeys and is truly one of the best and most moving books of travel ever written. Join Scott's expedition as he and his team venture deep into the frozen unknown.

In <em>Cast of Characters</em>, Thomas Vinciguerra paints a portrait of the magazine&#x2019;s cadre of charming, wisecracking, driven, troubled, brilliant writers and editors.</p><p>He introduces us to Wolcott Gibbs, theater critic, all-around wit, and author of an infamous 1936 parody of <em>Time</em> magazine. We meet the demanding and eccentric founding editor Harold Ross, who would routinely tell his underlings, "I'm firing you because you are not a genius," and who once mailed a pair of his underwear to Walter Winchell, who had accused him of preferring to go bare-bottomed under his slacks. Joining the cast are the mercurial, blind James Thurber, a brilliant cartoonist and wildly inventive fabulist, and the enigmatic E. B. White&#x2015;an incomparable prose stylist and Ross's favorite son&#x2015;who married <em>The New Yorker</em>'s formidable fiction editor, Katharine Angell. Then there is the dashing St. Clair McKelway, who was married five times and claimed to have no fewer than twelve personalities, but was nonetheless a superb reporter and managing editor alike. Many of these characters became legends in their own right, but Vinciguerra also shows how, as a group, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#x2019;s inner circle brought forth a profound transformation in how life was perceived, interpreted, written about, and published in America.</p><p><em>Cast of Characters</em> may be the most revealing&#x2015;and entertaining&#x2015;book yet about the unique personalities who built what Ross called not a magazine but a "movement."</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Thomas Vinciguerra is a founding editor of The Week magazine and a regular contributor to the New York Times.

More recently, lay people and prominent celebrities such as Madonna, Roseanne, and Jerry Hall have turned to the Kabbalah to connect with their higher selves, maximize intuition, heal their spirits, and protect themselves from negative influences. With this accessible and beautiful volume, you can harness the power of this complex belief system for healing and protection. Use talismans, amulets, visualizations, and prayers to ward off the evil eye and other misfortunes, as well as to repel negative energies. Learn meditations for healing the body and the aura, to bring harmony and tranquility, to help express and receive love, and more. Kabbalistic practices are also included for dream interpretation, to turn a bad dream into a good dream, for divination, and for sexual magic.</p><p>This latest passenger to ride the Kabbalah bandwagon is practical, as promised in the title, but not remarkable. Lampert, a New Age healer, adopts a conversational tone, relating Kabbalah tips as imparted by her parents, as well as traditional, textual teachings. However, there is an overdose of the former and not enough of the latter too often, this primer devolves into a compendium of folk superstitions, masked under the generic rubric of "Kabbalah." Readers are told, for example, never to sew a garment while they are wearing it, praise any newborn baby, cut anyone's fingernails during a new moon or gaze into a broken mirror. The book is better when it seeks to apply textual Kabbalah directly to issues of self-protection; to this end, Lampert includes a helpful section relating the 10 Sephirot to various parts of the human body, to aid in health and healing. As in many other Kabbalah books, this mystical spirituality is essentially divorced from its Jewish roots, although Lampert does provide an introductory chapter on Kabbalah's origins. A final section on Kabbalah and the Hebrew alphabet would have been better placed toward the beginning, since Lampert refers to numerology and the significance of the 22 Hebrew letters throughout, but does not clarify their importance. The full-color illustrations, which appear on every page, are nicely arranged to interpret the text, but not aesthetically sophisticated. In all, this basic guide is accessible no esoterica in sight but only mediocre.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Panorama, 4th Edition</h2><p>Panorama, 4th Edition, Student Edition with Supersite Code</p><p></p><h2>C.

Willfully stunting his growth at three feet for many years, wielding his tin drum and piercing scream as anarchistic weapons, he provides a profound yet hilarious perspective on both German history and the human condition in the modern world.<br><br>Introduction by John Reddick; Translation by Ralph Manheim</p><p>Meet Oskar Matzerath, "the eternal three-year-old drummer." On the morning of his third birthday, dressed in a striped pullover and patent leather shoes, and clutching his drumsticks and his new tin drum, young Oskar makes an irrevocable decision: "It was then that I declared, resolved, and determined that I would never under any circumstances be a politician, much less a grocer; that I would stop right there, remain as I was--and so I did; for many years I not only stayed the same size but clung to the same attire." Here is a Peter Pan story with a vengeance. But instead of Never-Never Land, G�nter Grass gives us Danzig, a contested city on the Polish-German border; instead of Captain Hook and his pirates, we have the Nazis. And in place of Peter himself is Oskar, a twisted <i>puer aeternis</i> with a scream that can shatter glass and a drum rather than a shadow. First published in 1959, <i>The Tin Drum</i>'s depiction of the Nazi era created a furor in Germany, for the world of Grass's making is rife with corrupt politicians and brutal grocers in brown shirts: <blockquote> There was once a grocer who closed his store one day in November, because something was doing in town; taking his son Oskar by the hand, he boarded a Number 5 streetcar and rode to the Langasser Gate, because there as in Zoppot and Langfuhr the synagogue was on fire. The synagogue had almost burned down and the firemen were looking on, taking care that the flames should not spread to other buildings. Outside the wrecked synagogue, men in uniform and others in civilian clothes piled up books, ritual objects, and strange kinds of cloth. The mound was set on fire and the grocer took advantage of the opportunity to warm his fingers and his feelings over the public blaze. </blockquote> As Oskar grows older (though not taller), portents of war transform into the thing itself. Danzig is the first casualty when, in the summer of 1939, residents turn against each other in a pitched battle between Poles and Germans. In the years that follow, Oskar goes from one picaresque adventure to the next--he joins a troupe of traveling musicians; he becomes the leader of a group of anarchists; he falls in love; he becomes a recording artist--until some time after the war, he is convicted of murder and confined to a mental hospital. <p> <i>The Tin Drum</i> uses savage comedy and a stiff dose of magical realism to capture not only the madness of war, but also the black cancer at the heart of humanity that allows such degradations to occur. Grass wields his humor like a knife--yes, he'll make you laugh, but he'll make you bleed, as well. There have been many novels written about World War II, but only a handful can truly be called great; <i>The Tin Drum</i>, without a doubt, is one. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"When G�nter Grass published <b>The Tin Drum</b> in 1959, it was as if German literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction. Within the pages of this, his first novel, Grass re-created the lost world from which his creativity sprang: Danzig, his home town, as he remembered it from the years of his infancy before the catastrophe of war. Here he comes to grips with the enormous task of reviewing contemporary history by recalling the disavowed and the forgotten: the victims, losers, and lies that people wanted to forget because they had once believed in them. The unforgettable Oskar Matzerath is an intellectual whose critical approach is childishness, a one-man carnival, dadaism in action in everyday German provincial life just when this small world becomes involved in the sanity of the great world surrounding it. It is not too audacious to assume that <b>The Tin Drum</b> will become one of the enduring literary works of the twentieth century."<br>-- The Swedish Academy, awarding G�nter Grass the Nobel Prize for Literature, 1999</p><h2>Mother Wonderful&#39;s Chicken Soup</h2><p><i>Early one morning, when you know your daughter is having a busy day, call her and say you're catching a cold. Ask if she can spare a few minutes to drive you to a butcher on the other side of town so you can buy a chicken with feet for soup. Everybody knows chicken soup is the best defense against germs...</i><br>Thus begins Myra Chanin's uproarious tribute to the art of making chicken soup. Flavored with a dash of mother-knows-best wisdom and thickened with equal doses of guilt and guile, <i>Mother Wonderful's Chicken Soup</i> is profusely illustrated with photos of Myra Chanin's actual mother, Sylvia. This book is narrated in a voice we can all recognize: <i>"Greet the butcher as if he were your brother instead of a person who intends to sell you an inferior chicken...."</i></p><p>Who knew making chicken soup could result in years of expensive therapy? According to Myra Chanin's <i>Mother Wonderful's Chicken Soup</i>, this particular potage is a real emotional minefield, apparent in the opening lines of the book: "Early one morning ... when you know your daughter is having a busy day, call your daughter and say you're catching cold. Ask if she can spare a few minutes to drive you to a kosher butcher so you can buy a chicken with feet for soup. Everybody knows chicken soup is the best defense against germs. Remind her how quickly a cold can turn into double pneumonia, which everybody knows is the number one killer of senior citizens...." Obviously, these directions are above and beyond those you find in an ordinary recipe! <p> Accompanying Chanin's hilarious instructions--covering every step from buying a chicken ("Greet the owner as if he were your favorite brother, rather than a person who intends to sell you a defective chicken") and preparing the soup ("Wash your hands before and after you touch anything.... Avoid adding germs to your soup") to serving it ("When they ask you why you aren't joining them, tell them you'll eat after you finish cleaning the kitchen")--are photographs of the author's own mother demonstrating her technique. Oh yes, there are also many delightful recipes at the back of the book for other chicken dishes and side dishes. Just think--with the money you save using <i>all</i> the parts of the chicken, you'll be able to afford a really <i>great</i> therapist!</p></p><h2>Mastering The Tarot: Lessons in an Ancient Mystic Art</h2><p>Mastering The Tarot: Lessons in an Ancient Mystic Art (Signet)</p><p></p><h2>ENGLISH RENAISSANCE POETRY: A Collection of Shorter Poems from Skelton to Jonson</h2><p>Including authoritative texts of poems by twenty-three major and minor poets&#x2014;from John Donne, Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson to George Gasciogne and Fulke Greville&#x2014;and Williams' critical preface, English Renaissance Poetry remains an invaluable introductory anthology of short poems from our first modern poetry.</p><p></p><h2>Gateways (Repairman Jack)</h2><p>Following last year's successful <i>The Haunted Air</i>, F.

Mark Ribowsky&#39;s concise history masterfully evokes these long-gone days with portraits of such Hall of Fame players as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell. The story is bittersweet--though various incarnations of the Negro Leagues survived well into the 1950s, the end of the leagues was sealed when the Brooklyn Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson in 1945.Baseball apartheid existed until Jackie Robinson broke that barrier in 1947. Ironically, with the integration of major league baseball, the death knell was rung for "blackball." In this blunt look at the Negro leagues, Ribowsky (Don't Look Back) unsentimentally chronicles what he calls the penal colony of American baseball. Frozen out of the major as well as the minor leagues in the late 19th century, blacks were forced to form their own leagues. These leagues, which became "a black social requisite," produced some of the greatest players ever: the first genuine "blackball" star, Andrew "Rube" Foster, whose fastball and business instincts were always on target; the legendary Satchel Paige, "blackball's first major cult hero"; Josh Gibson, blackball's Babe Ruth; and a kid with a sweet swing who went by the sobriquet "Pork Chops"-Henry Aaron. Ribowsky pays special attention to the business of black baseball for its ingenious and often inspired financial manipulation and chides major league baseball about the fact that there are no black executives in the Hall of Fame. Ribowsky also looks at the hypocrisy of the white baseball hierarchy, who would not employ black players but who, like the New York Yankees, would rent out their stadiums to blacks at more than $100,000 a year. A no-nonsense look at a time when only the ball was white.

The contributors analyze not just the greatest land battles of all time, but sieges such as Constantinople (1453) and Tenochtitl�n (1521); naval battles such as Actium (31 BC), Trafalgar (1805), and Tsushima (1905); and the crucial conflicts in the air during the Battle of Britain (1940) and the American attack on Japan (1945).<br><br>The coverage is truly worldwide in scope, from the battle in Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where the Germans defeated the Romans, to Hakata Bay in 1281, where the Japanese defeated the Mongols, and the first battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Mughals conquered Hindustan. The reader is presented with a masterly overview of advances in military technology, and of the changing tactics and strategy of battlefield commanders from Hannibal to Napoleon, Montgomery, and Eisenhower.<br><br>Richly illustrated in color with hundreds of photographs, contemporary paintings, and specially commissioned battle plans and maps, this will be essential reading for anyone interested in military history. 350 illustrations, 230 in color.</p><p><b>Jeremy Black</b> is Professor of History at the University of Exeter and the author or editor of more than forty books, including <i>World War Two: A Military History</i> and <i>The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution, 1492-1792.</i>Black explains that two major criteria guided the selection of 70 great battles: the cultural consequence and the encapsulation of the technologies and tactics of warfare. Black's team of historians employ a uniform graphical layout consisting of a fact box of forces, a map, color paintings or photographs, and a condensed analytic narrative. The technology theme, which so fascinates many readers of military history, does not accelerate, of course, until discussion of the battles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, whereas the clash-of-cultures theme dominates analysis of battles of the ancient and medieval periods. Marathon and Salamis, having preserved the Greek cradle of Western civilization, open the volume, and supporting its midsection is the collection of conflicts that delineated Europe's Christian/Muslim cultural frontier. With firepower supplanting muscle power from the 1600s forward, Black's battle accounts increasingly weigh commanders' adroitness with new weaponry. Visually emphatic, Black's informative introduction to warfare's history represents a browsing foundation for further reading. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Selections from religious, literary and philosophic works are preceded by introductory material that summarizes historical developments and cultural movements. While much attention is given to religion, many selections deal with social life, political relationships, and the Indian attitude to human love and passion. The arrangement of the material suggests the growth and development of Indian life through the centuries, and makes clear that Indian culture has never been static, but rather has been characterized at all times by a remarkable vitality and creativity.<br><br>The selections range in time from the Rig Veda, composed around 1000 B.C., to the writings of Radhakrishnan, formerly the President of India. They illustrate both the continuity of the Hindu tradition and its vitality, for Hinduism is probably more vibrant and alive at the present time than it has been for many centuries. The ideals and values, the unquestioned assumptions and the persistent doubts that are presented here from the literature of the past are the fundamental ingredients of the life of modern India.</p><p><b>Ainslie Thomas Embree</b>&nbsp;was born in Nova Scotia and educated at Dalhousie University in Halifax and Columbia University.

He now lives with his wife, Krystyna, in Pennsylvania.Following his bestselling FLY FISHING THROUGH THE MIDLIFE CRISIS, Raines muses upon the scandal that got him fired from THE NEW YORK TIMES, as well as politics, statecraft, his psyche, journalism, and angling as restorative and metaphor. Rambling between anecdotes, observations, and apologia, he writes gracefully and conversationally with an authorial voice reminiscent of his rural Alabama roots. Ignoring the Dixie grace notes of the prose, Tom Stechschulte opens in a rapturous tone, as if catching fish has revealed to him the meaning of life. He soon settles into a more appropriate cracker barrel folksiness. Afterwards, he seems consistently to hit the right notes, except for missing some of the author's slyly ironic humor.

A young boy, Elijah, meets Jesus and rushes home to tell his mother, expressing his desire to give Jesus a gift. He looks around at their meager possessions, but nothing seems suitable. His mother reassures him that Jesus won't care about the size of the gift.

One day he and his mother go to hear Jesus teach. A large crowd has gathered, and soon everyone is hungry and tired. Elijah and his mother have brought only enough food for themselves, but they offer Jesus what they have. Of course, it is with their small offering that Jesus feeds the thousands on the hillside.

It is a game played by our mind against its own bad habits. Replacing one pattern of behaviour with a new, more positive one is the purpose of the &#34;Inner Game&#34;. Peak performance at tennis, like any sport, only comes when our mind is so focused that it is still and at one with what our body is doing. The key to the &#34;Inner Game&#34; and better tennis is achieving this state of relaxed concentration so that we are playing &#34;out of our mind&#34; and therefore no worrying about how, when or where to hit the ball. In The Inner Game of Tennis, Tim Gallwey, a professional player and instructor who has produced dramatic results among the amateurs and pros he has trained, explores how to overcome mental obstacles, improve concentration and reduce anxiety for better performance at every level. There is no physical reason why any of us should not more consistently serve aces or hit perfect returns. The Inner Games approach makes all the difference.</p><p>A phenomenon when first published in 1972, the <i>Inner Game</i> was a real revelation. Instead of serving up technique, it concentrated on the fact that, as Gallwey wrote, "Every game is composed of two parts, an outer game and an inner game." The former is played against opponents, and is filled with lots of contradictory advice; the latter is played not against, but within the mind of the player, and its principal obstacles are self-doubt and anxiety. Gallwey's revolutionary thinking, built on a foundation of Zen thinking and humanistic psychology, was really a primer on how to get out of your own way to let your best game emerge. It was sports psychology before the two words were pressed against each other and codified into an accepted discipline.<p> The new edition of this remarkable work--Billie Jean King called the original her tennis bible--refines Gallwey's theories on concentration, gamesmanship, breaking bad habits, learning to trust yourself on the court, and awareness. "No matter what a person's complaint when he has a lesson with me, I have found the most beneficial first step," he stressed, "is to encourage him to <i>see</i> and <i>feel</i> what he is doing--that is, to increase his awareness of <i>what actually is</i>." </p><p> There are aspects of psychobabble and mysticism to be found here, sure, but Gallwey instructs as much by anecdote as anything else, and time has ultimately proved him a guru.

In the first half of the book, it reads like I&#x2019;m addressing Tristan directly, while the second half is a more straightforward narrative of Dima&#x2019;s adoption. They&#x2019;re both love letters to my boys, and the whole thing is a love letter to Kristin, my wife. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#x2019;ll also notice lots of frank, often sarcastic prose about cultural differences&#x2014;usually with the author as the punch line, as it was my inability to deal with these differences that provided a lot of humor (in retrospect) and anger (at the time). </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&#x2019;s also some tough content regarding infertility. If this is something you&#x2019;ve struggled with in your marriage, I hope this chapter encourages you, and I hope you feel less alone in your struggle. If you&#x2019;ve been blessed with biological children, please don&#x2019;t feel guilty for having them, or in any way judged or made fun of by the observations in that chapter (see also: It not being you, but me). </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the book contains lots of stories of God&#x2019;s faithfulness&#x2014;stories that we thought were too meaningful not to be told. Little &#x201c;piles of stones&#x201d; along the way that remind us of God&#x2019;s goodness, love, and faithfulness. We hope that you&#x2019;ll read them and not only be entertained, but be motivated to think of Christ and our adoption as His sons and daughters. It is only the love of Christ, and our hope in Him, that got us through the first, the most difficult adoption in the history of our agency&#x2019;s work with Ukraine, then infertility, and finally a second adoption. And it was these adoptions, more than any other events or events in our lives, that truly taught us to find our peace, comfort, and identity in Christ. &nbsp;</p></p><p><b>TED KLUCK</b> is co-author of <i>Why We�re Not Emergent</i> and author of <i>Facing Tyson, 15 Stories, Paper Tiger</i> and <i>Game Time</i>.

Her little sister, Rae, once tailed Izzy for weeks on end to discover the identity of Izzy&#x2019;s boyfriend. Her mother, Olivia, once blackmailed Izzy with photo�graphic evidence of Prom Night 1994.

She&nbsp;lives and works in upstate New York.*Starred Review* Trouble always has a way of finding Isabel Spellman, the snarky, whip-smart sleuth at the heart of Lutz&#x2019;s best-selling series. Although Izzy has plenty of clients to keep her busy, much of her time is devoted to dealing with the mischievous staff at Spellman Investigations, aka her own family. Her mother and father lack any semblance of professionalism, opting to hide out in their bedroom sipping coffee rather than attending firm meetings (or do much work, for that matter). And Izzy&#x2019;s sassy younger sister, Rae, has proved herself a master (mistress?) of blackmail and bribes. This time around, however, Izzy&#x2019;s woes stem not from next of kin but from an uberwealthy former client named Edward Slayter, who&#x2019;s accused Izzy of embezzlement. Slayter, it turns out, has early-stage Alzheimer&#x2019;s and is desperate to hide his diagnosis from colleagues and friends. Izzy is doing her best to keep Slayter&#x2019;s secret&#x2014;and save her own neck. Many of Lutz&#x2019;s quirky characters make appearances here, from Izzy&#x2019;s charming ex-boyfriend (and San Francisco cop) Henry Stone to her brother, David, who&#x2019;s traded the buttoned-up world of high finance for the demanding&#x2014;and disheveled&#x2014;life of a stay-at-home dad.

In a book that spans three decades, author Maeve Binchy follows pale, timid Elizabeth and her red-haired, Irish-Catholic "sister," Aisling, through first loves, weddings, drunken brawls, funerals, and births. Reader Kate Binchy, the author's cousin, nimbly carries the listener from England to Ireland and back again.

By 1420, German and Swiss cardmakers were producing packs by the thousands (first by stencil, later by metal engraving) marked with a bewildering array of suits, including hounds, bears, parrots, roses, helmets, banners, and bells. Games proliferated as well, and by 1534, Rabelais could name 35 different card games in Chapter 22 of <em>Gargantua</em>. Today, of course, there are thousands of games, from the universally popular Poker and Contract Bridge, to national manias such as Swiss Jass, German Skat, and French Belote.<br> Now, in <em>The Oxford Guide to Card Games</em>, internationally renowned game expert David Parlett provides a fascinating historical guide to cards in Europe and America. Unlike other books, this is not primarily a book of rules or hints on how to play better, but a unique survey of where the games originated, how they have developed over time, and what their rituals and etiquette tell us about the people who play them. Parlett discusses such ancient games as Karnoffel (German for "hernia"), in which the King could be captured by cards named Pope, Kaiser, Devil, and Karnoffel (this subversive ranking was decried by civic authorities and Karnoffel was even banned in Augsburg in 1446, but it was very popular among soldiers and workers). We learn that the term "Bower" in Euchre comes from the German word <em>Bauer</em> (<em>Boer</em> in Dutch), which means "farmer" or "Jack," and that Poker comes from the German word <em>Pocher</em>, which means "bash" or "pulverize" or "brag" (Poker is, as Parlett points out, ultimately a bragging game, in which players boast--or bet--that their hand is best). And we follow the rise and fall of such games as Piquet, which was once far and away the best loved game in Europe, and Canasta, which became a world-wide phenomenon in the 1950s, for a while rivaling Contract Bridge in popularity.<br> The first book to explore the history of cards in the West, this attractively illustrated volume is both informative and entertaining. Whether your favorite game is Poker or Pinocle, Cribbage or Gin, Contract Bridge or Crazy Eights, you will find much here to fascinate and amuse.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>David Parlett</strong> is one of the world's leading authorities on games. He is the author of many books on card and word games, the inventor of several board games, including <em>Hare and Tortoise</em>, which has been published in ten languages, and an adviser to film and television companies as well as computer firms producing card-playing software.<br>In this book Parlett recounts the history and evolution of the cards used in different countries and different games. He also classifies the various types of games and shows how they developed. However, this book is not about how to play cards. It does not give the "official rules" of most games nor does it attempt to describe the tactics or strategies associated with the individual games. In fact, if you do not already know a game being described, the rules given would be barely sufficient to get you started. However, the book would be an excellent starting point for someone interested in doing historical research on cards and card-playing. For this reason and because of the continuing popularity of card-playing as a hobby, the book is a worthwhile addition to larger public library collections.<br><i>- Harold D.

With a renewed zest for living, he embarks on a joyful killing spree, having found the true purpose of his existence.</p><p>"Like all great writers, Selby does not answer questions. He only raises them to a pitch so intense that only a scream or a prayer can stop the pain."&#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p></p><p>Hubert Selby, Jr. was born in Brooklyn in 1928. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: &#39;I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.&#39; In 1964 he completed his first book, Last Exit to Brooklyn, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include The Room, The Demon, Requiem for a Dream, Song of the Silent Snow, The Willow Tree and Waiting Period. In 2000, Requiem for a Dream starred Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn and was directed by Darren Aronofsky. Hubert Selby Jr died in Highland Park, Los Angeles, California in April 2004.Selby's latest offers a chilling look into the mind of a killer, as the author of Last Exit to Brooklyn uses stream-of-consciousness first-person narration to slowly transform his anonymous male narrator from a paranoid, disaffected war veteran into a deranged murderer. The catalytic event that initiates the transformation is the narrator's attempt to purchase a gun to commit suicide, but when a brief waiting period ensues, he decides instead to get even with his various tormentors. The first target is the bureaucrat at the Veterans Administration who has been denying the narrator his benefits, an alleged injustice he remedies by slipping the man a lethal dose of E. coli bacteria. The narrator goes through a brief period of killer's remorse, during which he almost confesses to a newsstand operator, but once his jitters pass, he targets a local TV celebrity for another dose of lethal bacteria. From there he goes completely over the edge, building a homemade crossbow as he explores the feasibility of using explosives to facilitate similar attacks in various cities around the country. Selby's style is relentless, harrowing and frighteningly effective, albeit somewhat monotonous and tough to read; this might have been a better novel if Selby had introduced some secondary characters and broken up the first-person narrative into chapters built around each incident. Still, in a world in which the reach of terrorism seems to grow on a daily basis, this story is a disturbing reminder of how vulnerable we are to attacks from the discontented and deranged, regardless of their location or nationality.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Saga of the Renunciates (The Shattered Chain, Thendara House, City of Sorcery) (Darkover)</h2><p><b>Return to the genre-bending world of Darkover, to a trilogy that follows the thrilling story of two Free Amazon women</b><br><br>In the three novels which comprise THE SAGA OF THE RENUNCIATES, Marion Zimmer Bradley tells the masterful tale of two valiant women who face and try to break the invisible chains of custom, convention, habit and expectation with which society binds women, and women bind themselves.<br><br>Magdalen Lorne is a Terran woman born and reared on Darkover.

Tom Wessels synthesizes history, geology, biology, and personal narrative to enhance our understanding and appreciation of these high, wild places. He explores the unique and fragile ecosystem that is common to exposed granite expanses from Acadia to Yosemitehow it evolved slowly over millennia, and how it is threatened today by foot traffic and overuse. Wessels' dramatic photographs and Brian Cohen's beautifully detailed illustrations bring the denizens of the granite bald to life. The mountains they celebrate include: Acadia National Park in Maine; the White Mountains of New Hampshire; the Adirondacks of New York; the Wind Rivers of Wyoming; the Beartooths of Montana; the Enchantments of Washington; and Yosemite National Park in California. 18 black &amp; white photographs, 30 illustrations, 1 map, glossary, index.</p><p>Tom Wessels is an ecologist and the author of Reading the Forested Landscape and Forest Forensics. He is the director of the Environmental Biology program at Antioch New England Graduate School.Why would a man who is neither a geologist nor a rock climber write about granite domes? Because he has an inordinate fondness for lichen: "I am particularly enamored of the moss and fuiticose lichen communities on granite outcrops," writes Wessels, a professor of ecology at Antioch New England Graduate School and chair of the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation. "Looking down at them from a few feet above, I am reminded of flying over mixed forests of conifers and hardwoods Lilliputian woodlands surrounded by crustose-lichen covered fields." Wessels tracks the unique lichen and shrub ecology of barren granite mountains that exists in Acadia and Yosemite National Parks, as well as the White Mountains (NH), Adirondacks (NY), Wind Rivers (WY), Beartooths (MT), and Enchantments (WA). This is a natural history in the best tradition, describing how geology, geomorphology, plant community interactions, environmental forces, and human history are all interrelated. Written with a combination of scientific clarity and poetry, this book will give readers a new appreciation for life in these austere yet intricate places. For most collections.

The scarlets of the red maples were dominant, but they were being joined now by the greenish yellow leaves of the red oaks; the silver of the bigtooth aspens; and the greens of the quaking aspens, the birches, and the beeches. Poplars and willows, elms and hazelnuts were all bursting into full bloom, and the woods were ringing with the noise of returning birds.<br><br>I could see the woods from the gym at One City Center, the tips of the evergreens still dominating the landscape amid the slowly transforming seasonals. Rain was falling on the streets of Portland and umbrellas swarmed on the streets below, glistening darkly like the carapaces of squat black beetles.<br><br>For the first time in many months, I felt good. I was in semiregular employment. I was eating well, working out three or four days each week, and Rachel Wolfe was coming up from Boston for the weekend, so I would have someone to admire my improving physique. I hadn't suffered bad dreams for some time. My dead wife and my lost daughter had not appeared to me since the previous Christmas, when they touched me amid the falling snow and gave me some respite from the visions that had haunted me for so long.<br><br>I completed a set of military presses and laid the bar down, sweat dripping from my nose and rising in little wisps of steam from my body. Seated on a bench, sipping some water, I watched the two men enter from the reception area, glance around, then fix on me. They wore conservative dark suits with somber ties. One was large, with brown wavy hair and a thick mustache, like a porn star gone to seed, the bulge of the gun in the cheap rig beneath his jacket visible to me in the mirror behind him. The other was smaller, a tidy, dapper man with receding, prematurely graying hair. The big man held a pair of shades in his hand while his companion wore a pair of gold-rimmed eyeglasses with square frames. He smiled as he approached me.<br><br>"Mr. Parker?" he asked, his hands clasped behind his back.<br><br>I nodded and the hands disengaged, the right extending toward me in a sharp motion like a shark making its way through familiar waters.<br><br>"My name is Quentin Harrold, Mr. Parker," he said. "I work for Mr. Jack Mercier."<br><br>I wiped my own right hand on a towel to remove some of the sweat, then accepted the handshake. Harrold's mouth quivered a little as my still sweaty palm gripped his, but he resisted the temptation to wipe his hand clean on the side of his trousers. I guessed that he didn't want to spoil the crease.<br><br>Jack Mercier came from money so old that some of it had jangled on the Mayflower. He was a former U.S. senator, as his father and grandfather had been before him, and lived in a big house out on Prouts Neck overlooking the sea. He had interests in timber companies, newspaper publishing, cable television, software, and the Internet. In fact, he had interests in just about anything that might ensure the Merciers' old money was regularly replenished with injections of new money. As a senator he had been something of a liberal and he still supported various ecological and civil rights groups through generous donations. He was a family man; he didn't screw around -- as far as anyone knew -- and he had emerged from his brief flirtation with politics with his reputation enhanced rather than tarnished, a product as much of his financial independence as of any moral probity. There were rumors that he was planning a return to politics, possibly as an independent candidate for governor, although Mercier himself had yet to confirm them.<br><br>Quentin Harrold coughed into his palm, then used it as an excuse to take a handkerchief from his pocket and discreetly wipe his hand. "Mr. Mercier would like to see you," he said, in the tone of voice he probably reserved for the pool cleaner and the chauffeur. "He has some work for you."<br><br>I looked at him. He smiled. I smiled back. We stayed like that, grinning at each other, until the only options were to speak or start dating. Harrold took the first option.<br><br>"Perhaps you didn't hear me, Mr. Parker," he said. "Mr. Mercier has some work for you."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>Harrold's smile wavered. "I'm not sure what you mean."<br><br>"I'm not so desperate for work, Mr. Harrold, that I run and fetch every time somebody throws a stick." This wasn't entirely true. Portland, Maine, wasn't such a wellspring of vice and corruption that I could afford to look down my nose at too many jobs. If Harrold had been better looking and a different sex, I'd have fetched the stick and then rolled onto my back to have my belly rubbed if I thought it might have earned me more than a couple of bucks.<br><br>Harrold glanced at the big guy with the mustache. The big guy shrugged, then went back to staring at me impassively, maybe trying to figure out what my head would look like mounted over his fireplace.<br><br>Harrold coughed again. "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to offend you." He seemed to have trouble forming the words, as if they were part of someone else's vocabulary and he was just borrowing them for a time. I waited for his nose to start growing or his tongue to turn to ash and fall to the floor, but nothing happened. "We'd be grateful if you'd spare the time to talk to Mr. Mercier," he conceded with a wince.<br><br>I figured that I'd played hard to get for long enough, although I still wasn't sure that they'd respect me in the morning. "When I've finished up here, I can probably drive out and see him," I said.<br><br>Harrold craned his neck slightly, indicating that he believed he might have misheard me. "Mr. Mercier was hoping that you could come with us now, Mr. Parker. Mr. Mercier is a very busy man, as I'm sure you'll understand."<br><br>I stood up, stretched, and prepared to do another set of presses. "Oh, I understand, Mr. Harrold. I'll be as quick as I can. Why don't you gentlemen wait downstairs, and I'll join you when I'm done? You're making me nervous. I might drop a weight on you."<br><br>Harrold shifted on his feet for a moment, then nodded.<br><br>"We'll be in the lobby," he said.<br><br>"Enjoy," I replied, then watched them in the mirror as they walked away.<br><br>I took my time finishing my workout, then had a long shower and talked about the future of the Pirates with the guy who was cleaning out the changing room. When I figured that Harrold and the porn star had spent enough time looking at their watches, I took the elevator down to the lobby and waited for them to join me. The expression on Harrold's face, I noticed, was oscillating between annoyance and relief.<br><br>Harrold insisted that I accompany him and his companion in their Mercedes, but despite their protests I opted to follow them in my own Mustang. It struck me that I was becoming more willfully perverse as I settled into my midthirties. If Harrold had told me to take my own car, I'd probably have chained myself to the steering column of the Mercedes until they agreed to give me a ride.<br><br>The Mustang was a 1969 Boss 302, and replaced the Mach 1 that had been shot to pieces the previous year. The 302 had been sourced for me by Willie Brew, who ran an auto shop down in Queens. The spoilers and wings were kind of over the top, but it made my eyes water when it accelerated and Willie had sold it to me for $8,000, which was about $3,000 less than a car in its condition was worth. The downside was that I might as well have had arrested adolescence painted on the side in big black letters.<br><br>I followed the Mercedes south out of Portland and on to U.S. 1. At Oak Hill, we turned east and I stayed behind them at a steady thirty all the way to the tip of the Neck. At the Black Point Inn, guests sat at the picture windows, staring out with drinks in their hands at Grand Beach and Pine Point. A Scarborough PD cruiser inched along the road, making sure that everybody stayed under thirty and nobody unwanted hung around long enough to spoil the view.<br><br>Jack Mercier had his home on Winslow Homer Road, within sight of the painter's former house. As we approached, an electronically operated barrier opened and a second Mercedes swept toward us from the house, headed for Black Point Road. In the backseat sat a small man with a dark beard and a skullcap on his head. We exchanged a look as the two cars passed each other, and he nodded at me. His face was familiar, I thought, but I couldn't place it. Then the road was clear and we continued on our way.<br><br>Mercier's home was a huge white place with landscaped gardens and so many rooms that a search party would have to be organized if anybody got lost on the way to the bathroom. The man with the mustache parked the Mercedes while I followed Harrold through the large double front doors, down the hallway, and into a room to the left of the main stairs. It was a library, furnished with antique couches and chairs. Books stretched to the ceiling on three walls; on the east-facing wall, a window looked out on the grounds and the sea beyond, a desk and chair beside it and a small bar to the right.<br><br>Harrold closed the door behind me and left me to examine the spines on the books and the photographs on the wall. The books ranged from political biographies to historical works, mainly examinations of the Civil War, Korea, and Vietnam. There was no fiction. In one corner was a small locked cabinet with a glass front. The books it contained were different from those on the open shelves. They had titles like <i>Myth and History in the Book of Revelation; Apocalypse and Millennium in English Romantic Poetry; The Book of Revelation: Apocalypse and Empire;</i> and <i>The Apocalyptic Sublime.</i> It was cheerful stuff: bedtime reading for the end of the world. There were also critical biographies of the artists William Blake, Albrecht Durer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and Jean Duvet, in addition to facsimile editions of what appeared to be medieval texts. Finally, on the top shelf were twelve almost identical slim volumes, each bound in black leather with six gold bands inset on the spine in three equidistant sets of two. At the base of each spine was the last letter of the Greek alphabet: W, for omega. There was no key in the lock, and the doors stayed closed when I gave them an experimental tug.<br><br>I turned my attention to the photographs on the walls. There were pictures of Jack Mercier with various Kennedys, Clintons, and even a superannuated Jimmy Carter. Others showed Mercier in an assortment of athletic poses from his youth: winning races, pretending to toss footballs, and being carried aloft on the shoulders of his adoring teammates. There were also testimonials from grateful universities, framed awards from charitable organizations headed by movie stars, and even some medals presented by poor but proud nations. It was like an underachiever's worst nightmare.<br><br>One more recent photograph caught my eye. It showed Mercier sitting at a table, flanked on one side by a woman in her sixties wearing a smartly tailored black jacket and a string of pearls around her neck. To Mercier's right was the bearded man who had passed me in the Mercedes, and beside him was a figure I recognized from his appearances on prime-time news shows, usually looking triumphant at the top of some courthouse steps: Warren Ober, of Ober, Thayer &amp; Moss, one of New England's top law firms. Ober was Mercier's attorney, and even the mention of his name was enough to send most opposition running for the hills. When Ober, Thayer &amp; Moss took a case, they brought so many lawyers with them to court that there was barely enough room for the jury. Even judges got nervous around them.<br><br>Looking at the photograph, it struck me that nobody in it seemed particularly happy. There was an air of tension about the poses, a sense that some darker business was being conducted and the photographer was an unnecessary distraction. There were thick files on the table before them, and white coffee cups lay discarded like yesterday's roses.<br><br>Behind me the door opened and Jack Mercier entered, laying aside on the table a sheaf of papers speckled with bar charts and figures. He was tall, six-two or six-three, with shoulders that spoke of his athletic past and an expensive gold Rolex that indicated his present status as a very wealthy man. His hair was white and thick, swept back from a perma-tanned forehead over large blue eyes, a Roman nose, and a thin, smiling mouth, the teeth white and even. I guessed that he was sixty-five by now, maybe a little older. He wore a blue polo shirt, tan chinos, and brown Sebagos. There was white hair on his arms, and tufts of it peeked out over the collar of his shirt. For a moment the smile on his face faltered as he saw my attention focused on the photograph, but it quickly brightened again as I moved away from it. Meanwhile, Harrold stood at the door like a nervous matchmaker.<br><br>"Mr. Parker," said Mercier, shaking my hand with enough force to dislodge my fillings. "I appreciate you taking the time to see me." He waved me to a chair. From the hallway, an olive-skinned man in a white tunic appeared with a silver tray and set it down. Two china cups, a silver coffeepot, and a matching silver creamer and sugar bowl jangled softly as the tray hit the table. The tray looked heavy, and the servant seemed kind of relieved to be rid of it.<br><br>"Thank you," said Mercier. We watched as he left, Harrold behind him. Harrold gently closed the door, giving me one last pained look before he departed, then Mercier and I were alone.<br><br>"I know a lot about you, Mr. Parker," he began as he poured the coffee and offered me cream and sugar. He had an easy, unaffected manner, designed to put even the most fleeting of acquaintances at ease. It was so unaffected that he must have spent years perfecting it.<br><br>"Likewise," I replied.<br><br>He frowned good-naturedly. "I don't imagine you're old enough to have ever voted for me."<br><br>"No, you retired before it became an issue."<br><br>"Did your grandfather vote for me?"<br><br>My grandfather, Bob Warren, had been a Cumberland County sheriff's deputy and had lived in Scarborough all his life. My mother and I had come to stay with him after my father died. In the end, he outlived his own wife and daughter, and I had buried him one autumn day after his great heart failed him at last.<br><br>"I don't believe he ever voted for anyone, Mr. Mercier," I said. "My grandfather had a natural distrust of politicians." The only politician for whom my grandfather ever had any regard was President Zachary Taylor, who never voted in an election and didn't even vote for himself.<br><br>Jack Mercier grinned his big white grin again. "He might have been right. Most of them have sold their souls ten times over before they're even elected. Once it's sold, you can never buy it back. You just have to hope that you got the best price for it."<br><br>"And are you in the business of buying souls, Mr. Mercier, or selling them?"<br><br>The grin stayed fixed, but the eyes narrowed. "I take care of my own soul, Mr. Parker, and let other people do as they wish with theirs."<br><br>Our special moment was broken by the entrance of a woman into the room. She wore a deceptively casual outfit of black pants and a black cashmere sweater, and a thin gold necklace gleamed dully against the dark wool. She was about forty-five, give or take a year. Her hair was blond, fading to gray in places, and there was a hardness to her features that made her seem less beautiful than she probably thought she was.<br><br>This was Mercier's wife, Deborah, who had some kind of permanent residency in the local society pages. She was a Southe...</p><h2>Purpose and Desire: What Makes Something &#34;Alive&#34; and Why Modern Darwinism Has Failed to Explain It</h2><p><p>A professor, biologist, and physiologist argues that modern Darwinism&#x2019;s materialist and mechanistic biases have led to a scientific dead end, unable to define what life is&#x2014;and only an openness to the qualities of "purpose and desire" will move the field forward.</p><p>Scott Turner contends. "To be scientists, we force ourselves into a Hobson&#x2019;s choice on the matter: accept intentionality and purposefulness as real attributes of life, which disqualifies you as a scientist; or become a scientist and dismiss life&#x2019;s distinctive quality from your thinking. I have come to believe that this choice actually stands in the way of our having a fully coherent theory of life." </p><p>Growing research shows that&nbsp;life's most distinctive quality, shared by all living things, is&nbsp;purpose and desire: maintain homeostasis to sustain life. In <em>Purpose and Desire,</em> Turner draws on the work of Claude Bernard, a contemporary of Darwin revered among physiologists as the founder of experimental medicine, to build on Bernard&#x2019;s "dangerous idea" of vitalism, which seeks to identify what makes "life" a unique phenomenon of nature. To further its quest to achieve a fuller understanding of life, Turner argues, science must move beyond strictly accepted measures that consider only the mechanics of nature. </p><p>A thoughtful appeal to widen our perspective of biology that is grounded in scientific evidence, <em>Purpose and Desire</em> helps us bridge the ideological evolutionary divide.</p></p><p><p>Has Darwinism led us into a scientific dead end? </p><strong>DR.

The book ends with the porker waiting to play while his friend sits on the potty. Both text and illustrations are simple and endearing.

A heinous crime that occurred too close to home still has its grip on Chief Inspector Alan Banks&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s leading him into a dark place where evil still dwells. Because the secrets that doomed young Graham Marshall back in 1965 remain alive and lethal, and disturbing them could cost Banks much more than he ever imagined. </p><p>Master of suspense Peter Robinson once again delves into the human psyche to reveal what leads some to commit murder in this compelling, unforgettable thriller.</p></p><p>Having already shown, in 1999's <i>In a Dry Season</i>, that he can plumb historical homicide for gripping modern drama, Peter Robinson goes further in <i>Close to Home</i>, telling parallel stories about teenage boys lost in a grownup world, decades apart. The first is Graham Marshall, a childhood pal of Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks, who vanished mysteriously in 1965, the supposed victim of a pedophile. Hearing that Graham's bones have finally been unearthed, Banks quits his vacation in Greece and heads to his hometown of Petersborough, England, hoping to assist the investigation--and, perhaps, assuage his guilt over his friend&#x2019;s fate. Meanwhile, Banks's colleague and ex-lover, Annie Cabbot, is busy probing the recent disappearance of 15-year-old Luke Armitage, the sensitive, brainy son of a rock star who committed suicide during Luke's infancy. After Cabbot catches hell for interrupting what may or may not have been a legitimate ransom payment for Luke's return, she seeks Banks's advice, drawing these two plot lines neatly together.<p> As this intense and intricately crafted puzzler develops, blending fiction with a bit of fact (the Kray brothers, who ran a criminal ring in London's East End during the mid-20th century, play off-camera roles here), Robinson explores Banks's troubled relationship with his parents, especially his working-class father, who "had never approved of his choice of career." He also raises doubts about a famed copper who&#x2019;d originally tackled the Marshall case, involves Banks romantically with a damaged detective whose investigative diligence threatens her safety, and shows Cabbot as someone better and stronger than merely Banks's prot�g�. Working with themes of lost youth and the dark secrets hidden in small towns, Robinson delivers in this 13th Banks novel a police procedural of remarkable human depth. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p>While recuperating from the events of <i>Aftermath</i> on a Greek island, Inspector Alan Banks reads that the bones of his childhood friend, Graham Marshall, have been dug up in a field not far away from the road where he disappeared more than thirty-five years earlier. <br> <br>Intrigued by the discovery, and still consumed with guilt because of a related incident he failed to report at the time, Banks returns to his hometown in Cambridgeshire and becomes peripherally involved in the investigation, headed by newcomer Detective Inspector Michelle Hart. At the same time, a few counties away, the case of another missing teenager &#x2013; the son of a famous model and step-son of anex-footballer, is handed to DI Annie Cabbot. Banks shuttles between the two cases far apart in time but perhaps not so far apart in character. When the lives of both detectives are threatened, Banks searches his own memories for clues, until he is finally forced to confront truths he would rather avoid, and finds that, in these investigations, the boundary between victim and perpetrator, guardian of the law and law-breaker is becoming ever more blurred. <br> <br>A gripping crime novel, set in the present day, <i>The Summer That Never Was</i> is also a gritty and evocative portrait of northern England in the sixties, and an exploration of the nature of memory, the destruction of families, andadolescence. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Manhattan Project: The Birth of the Atomic Bomb in the Words of Its Creators, Eyewitnesses and Historians.</h2><p><b>The definitive collection of writings on the Manhattan Project by the pre-eminent scientists, historians, and the everyday observers who bore witness to the birth of the modern nuclear age.</b><br><br>Begun in 1939, the Manhattan Project eventually employed more than 130,000 people, including our foremost scientists and thinkers, and cost nearly $2 billion, while operating under a shroud of absolute secrecy.

Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain&#39;s exhaustively researched and astonishing account-part of it gleaned from secret government files-tells how the CIA became obsessed with LSD as an espionage weapon during the early l950s and launched a massive covert research program, in which countless unwitting citizens were used as guinea pigs. Though the CIA was intent on keeping the drug to itself, it ultimately couldn&#39;t prevent it from spreading into the popular culture; here LSD had a profound impact and helped spawn a political and social upheaval that changed the face of America. From the clandestine operations of the government to the escapades of Timothy Leary, Abbie Hoffman, Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, Allen Ginsberg, and many others, Acid Dreams provides an important and entertaining account that goes to the heart of a turbulent period in our history. &#34;Engaging throughout . . . at once entertaining and disturbing.&#34; - Andrew Weil, M.D., The Nation; &#34;Marvelously detailed . . . loaded with startling revelations.&#34; - Los Angeles Daily News; &#34;An engrossing account of a period . . . when a tiny psychoactive molecule affected almost every aspect of Western life.&#34; - William S.

In 1932, I was a layman of the Church, with a long-standing interest in Church history. As the centenary of the Oxford Movement approached, I noted that while the history of the movement in England had been told and retold, there was no corresponding account of the American developments of Tractarianism. With more courage than discretion, I set out to supply this want . . . .</p><p></p><h2>The Mad King: The Life and Times of Ludwig II of Bavaria</h2><p>On August 25, 1995, the German Republic celebrated the 150th anniversary of the birth of the most scorned and most beloved monarch of modern times: Ludwig II.<br>As a child, though physically beautiful, Ludwig was withdrawn and silent. Entering his teenage years, he determined that his desires were directed toward young men rather than the numerous girls presented as potential wives. Following a broken engagement to Princess Sophie of Austria, Ludwig never again considered marriage.<br>After ascending the throne at the age of eighteen, Ludwig became devoted to his major passions: music and architecture. Captivated by the music of Richard Wagner, the young king formed a bond with the composer and became his benefactor, enabling Wagner to create and produce his great operas. The royal love for architecture resulted in some of the world's most admired castles as well as the most extravagant. Berg, Hohenschwangau Castle, and Linderhof were jewels, but his crowning achievement, Neuschwanstein, rivaled any other on the continent, a monumental creation second only to the Hermitage.<br>An intemperate ruler, Ludwig changed the course of European history almost against his will. He launched Bavaria into two wars, and, with Bismarck, created the German Second Reich. As Prussia's power grew, he watched the newly unified country come under the sway of the Hohenzollerns rather than his own Wittelsbachs. He assuaged his disappointment by lavishing more of his treasury on art and on funding a new opera house for Wagner's work. He would frequently watch a Ring performance as the sole member of the audience. His own government and family plotted against him, called him mad, and forcibly overthrew him. After a single day at a sanatorium and a prolonged visit with a doctor, he vanished. His body was found in a lonely lake outside Munich. Was it suicide? Or murder?</p><p>Schattenkonig--shadow king--of a doomed monarchy from his accession at the age of 18 in 1864, Ludwig II reigned over Bavaria but never ruled. The day after his forced abdication in 1886, his body was found in Lake Starnberg, a presumed suicide. Neither lawgiver nor warrior, Ludwig left behind several dreamy, mock-Gothic castles and the music dramas of Wagner, whom he patronized. Despite his prodigality and retreat into brooding isolation, he is remembered almost wistfully as the storybook-handsome young sovereign whose early promise ended in insanity and mysterious death. There have been notable biographies in English, the last being Wilfrid Blunt's The Dream King, published in 1970. This newest life by King (The Man Who Killed Rasputin) is more informative about Ludwig's upbringing and inadequate preparation for his royal role. His "fragile sexual identity" also failed him; after the wedding to a teenage cousin was canceled, he hid away in castles far from the state capital of Munich to carry on what he thought were clandestine liaisons with princes and stableboys. By 30, dissipation had cost him his health and his looks. His relationship with Wagner, whom he had championed for 18 years, also went sour. The pathetic, decadent life of Ludwig II repels more than it enthralls, despite King's attempt to sentimentalize him and make him sympathetic. Illustrations not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ludwig II (1845-86) was eminently unsuited for the Bavarian throne. A dreamy, sensitive introvert, he shunned all court duties and society. Guilt-ridden over his homosexual desires, he never married, destabilizing Bavaria's throne while Bismarck's Prussia strengthened its position. Ludwig's only passionate interests were Richard Wagner's operas (Wagner wrote most of the Ring cycle for Ludwig) and building grand architectural follies like the famous Neuschwanstein Castle. Finally, his ministers, convinced he was insane, had him deposed and confined. One day later, he mysteriously drowned. King (The Man Who Killed Rasputin, LJ 11/15/95) gives a straightforward account of Ludwig's sad life, quoting many of Ludwig's letters to highlight his artistic, tormented soul. King also makes a convincing case for "death by misadventure," suggesting a drunken, overwrought Ludwig drowned in an escape attempt.

Reprint.</p><p><p><b>Carola Dunn</b> is the author of several series of novels, including Regency romances, the Daisy Dalrymple mysteries, the Cornish mysteries, and more than two dozen stand-alone novels.</p>A new adventure for gutsy features reporter Daisy Dalrymple, a daughter of the 1920s aristocracy (Styx and Stones, 1999, etc.), who's engaged to Scotland Yard's Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher--a fianc� her mother, the Dowager Lady Dalrymple, finds as objectionable as her profession. Assigned to write an article on London museums for an American magazine, Daisy visits the Natural History Museum--home to fossils, bones, minerals, and eventually murder. But not before Daisy meets Mineral Keeper Pettigrew and other curators--Septimus Mummery, head of Fossil Reptiles; Curator of Fossils Ruddlestone; dinosaur expert Steadman; anthropologist Finch Brown, from the British Museum; and a constant presence in the Natural History rooms--Grand Duke Rudolph Maximilian of Transcarpathia, ever gazing at the priceless ruby once owned by his grandfather. It's Daisy's ill-luck to be present when Dr. Pettigrew is found stabbed to death in the reptile gallery, evidently by a sharpened flint. A short time later the Duke's ruby is revealed as a fake, along with the entire collection of precious stones. Alec and his competent second-in-command Tom Tring work their way through a mass of suspects, motives, keys, caches, and opportunities, but it's Daisy, as usual, who paws through the exhibits to come up with the final answer.The museum seems to cast a pall over the proceedings this time out, with Daisy's role overexpanded but lacking its usual verve.

As their stories intertwine and build, SMACK never lets up the pace. It is a book about people, families--real and those constructed by young people with no one to turn to but each other. SMACK is a book about a drug and the hold it can have. Written directly for its audience of young people and unflinching in its honesty, SMACK is the teen book of the year.</p></p><p>Like so many teenagers, Tar and Gemma are fed up with their parents. Tar's family is alcoholic and abusive, and Gemma feels her home life is cramped by too many restrictions. The young, British couple runs away to Bristol in search of freedom, and finds it in the form of a "squat." This vacant building is also occupied by two slightly older teens who share everything with Tar and Gemma (including their heroin habits). For a while, everything is parties and adventures, but slowly Tar and Gemma find themselves growing more and more dependent on the drug--whose strict mandates are even less forgiving than those of the parents they fled. As Gemma says, "You take more and more, and more often. Then you get sick of it and give up for a few days. And that's the really nasty thing because then, when you're clean, that's when it works so well." <p> With <i>Smack</i>, winner of the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Prize for Fiction, Melvin Burgess brilliantly sketches a gradual descent into drug addiction. There is no preaching here, just the artful revelation of cold, hard facts. Burgess's use of the first-person voice--for not only the main characters but those in the background as well--brings you into the mind of every character in this homeless, hooked culture, offering a (sometimes terrible) glimpse of the motivations and transitions of each person. (Tar's personality changes dramatically over the course of the book, from sweet-natured, lonely boy to hard-edged, hit-seeking addict.) More subtle and less graphic than <i>Beauty Queen</i>, Linda Glovach's tale of a girl's downward spiral into heroin addiction, <i>Smack</i> will linger in the your mind long after its haunting conclusion has been reached.

(suspense). By the best-selling author of I, Sniper.</p><p><b>Stephen Hunter </b>has written seventeen novels, including <i>I, Sniper</i> and <i>Point of Impact</i>.

It was the day after the ambush. The flesh wound in Cruz&#x2019;s right thigh still oozed blood and the entire right side of his body wore a purple-yellow smear of bruise. It hurt so bad he could hardly negotiate the raw landscape that strobed in and out of focus all around him in the harsh sunlight. But Ray Cruz, a gunnery sergeant in the United States Marine Corps, was one of those rare men with a personality of hard metal&#x2014;unmalleable, impenetrable, unstoppable. Back at battalion, he was called the Cruise Missile. Once fired, he kept moving until he hit the target. Since 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion was a Special Forces&#x2013;rated unit, it got all the cool jobs, and he was the go-to guy on patrol security, Agency snatch-and-grabs and various countersniper and IED problems. He ran Sniper Platoon. He was always there, in the shadows on the ridge line or the village roof&#x2014;sometimes spottered up, sometimes not, with his SR-25, a beast of a .308 semiauto with a yard of optics up top&#x2014;paying out survival for his people at long range in packages that weighed 175 grains apiece. He never missed, he never counted or cared about the kills.<br> <br>Yet now, no one would confuse him for what he was. He was dressed in the loose-fitting, easy-flowing tribal garments of the Pashtun, the people of the mountains. He looked like Lawrence of Afghanistan. His brown face was crusty with beard and filth, his lips cracked. He wore sandals and a burnoose, obscuring his visage, and not one item of government-issue clothing. He was also among goats.<br> <br>There were fourteen of them left. It is fine to love animals until you try to herd goats. The goats weren&#x2019;t into team spirit. They free-ranged, somewhat raggedly, depending on need or whim, and Cruz was able to keep them moving roughly forward by constant screaming and beating with his staff. And when he swatted at them with the staff, the weight went to his damaged leg and a new blade of pain thrust up into his guts. They shat everywhere, without apparent effort or awareness. They attracted flies in clouds. They smelled of shit and blood and dust and piss. They babbled constantly, not so much a classic <i>bah-bah-bah</i> but more of a whiney singsong bleating, like kids on a long bus ride. He hated them. He wanted to kill them with the rifle under his robes, eat them, and go home. But he had a goddamned job to do and he could not make himself quit on that job. It wasn&#x2019;t will or habit, it certainly wasn&#x2019;t out of any notion of the heroic or Semper Fi or memories of Iwo and Chosin and Belleau Wood. It was just that his mind wasn&#x2019;t organized in such a way as to consider alternatives.<br> <br>The rifle shifted uncomfortably under his swirl of robes. It was a little lighter than the SR-25, a Russian-designed, Chinese-manufactured thing called a Dragunov SVD, with a skeletal wooden stock and a longish barrel, looking a little like an AK-47 stretched in a medieval torture machine. A battlefield pickup from some long-forgotten firefight that its owner came out of second-place winner, its strap bit into his shoulder and its rough surfaces gouged him as it slipped this way or that. It was awkward, a heavy piece of crudely machined parts, mostly metal, with knobs, bolts, buttons, ledges, and all sorts of things sticking out of it. It represented the Russian school of ergonomics that was &#x201c;Fuck you, end user.&#x201d; A Chinese 4� sight had been clamped on top with a strange range finder&#x2014;it looked like a cartoon of a ski-jump slope&#x2014;as part of the reticle information that only someone from an East-bloc culture could dream up. He hated it. Yet he was lucky to have it. And one magazine of ten 7.62 � 54 sniper-grade Chinese cartridges.<br> <br>It was all he had left. He&#x2019;d started with a spotter, an ample supply of food and water, and no bullet having blown six ounces of flesh off his leg. The trek the long way around to Qalat would only be three days in. After the shot, maybe a day of escape and evasion. Then his spotter would put in the call, and a Night Stalker would helo them out and they&#x2019;d be back at FOB Winchester in time for beer and steak. And the Beheader, as Ibrahim Zarzi, warlord of the southeastern Pashtun tribes, opium merchant, prince, spy, charmer, betrayer, Taliban sympathizer, and Al-Qaeda liaison was known, would be sucking poppy from the root end first.<br> <br>But it didn&#x2019;t happen that way. Reality seldom follows mission-op outlines.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why send men, Major?&#x201d; Ray had asked the battalion intelligence officer, the S-2, in the S-2 bunker, to an audience of the CO, the exec, and the Sniper Platoon lieutenant. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t our Agency friends send a missile? Isn&#x2019;t that what they do? Have some zen master pinball kid sitting in a trailer in Vegas flying a joystick take him out with a Hellfire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ray, I shouldn&#x2019;t tell you this,&#x201d; Colonel Laidlaw said, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s your ass on the line, so you have a right to know. The Administration has tightened up on the missile hits. Too much collateral. The UN squawking. This guy&#x2019;s complex is in heavy urban. You go all Hellfire on his ass, yes, you probably send him to his God. But you send two hundred other rug weavers along with him and you&#x2019;ve got the <i>New York Times</i> violin section in full blast. These folks don&#x2019;t like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, sir. I can take him. I&#x2019;m just worried about the E and E from Qalat. I want to get my guy out and also my own ass. Can we have Warthogs standing by to cowboy up the place if it gets tight? We won&#x2019;t have enough firepower to shoot our way out of anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can get you Apaches ASAP. Our Apaches. I don&#x2019;t want to lay on Air Force Warthogs because I&#x2019;ve got to go through too many chains of command and too many people have to sign off on it. It&#x2019;s not all that secure.&#x201d;<br> <br>The marines liked the Air Force guys because they thought the A-10 gun tubs were so well armored the pilots had the confidence to get down to marine level before they started blowing shit up and killing people. They thought their own pilots lacked the killer instinct&#x2014;and the armor&#x2014;for nose-in-the-dirt flying. They hung far off, launched Hellfires, then went home and slept between clean sheets after martinis in the officers&#x2019; club. Some even had girlfriends, it was rumored.<br> <br>So: no Hogs, maybe Apaches. That was it and it never occurred to Ray to come up with a turndown. If he didn&#x2019;t do it, somebody else would, and whoever that somebody was, he wouldn&#x2019;t be as good as Ray.<br> <br>It had to be done. The Beheader&#x2014;the nickname came because it was rumored he was the mastermind behind a kidnapped journalist who&#x2019;d suffered that fate when he&#x2019;d gone off on his own in Qalat to get the Taliban side of the story&#x2014;was an eternal problem for marines in the southeastern operating area. When IEDs went off as command vehicles passed in resupply convoys, it was because the Beheader&#x2019;s spies had infiltrated and knew how to ID the one Humvee out of twenty-five that carried brass. When patrols were ambushed, and major ops had to be launched to get them out of the trouble they&#x2019;d gotten into, and the shooters had mysteriously vanished into nothingness, it was suspected they had simply ducked into the off-limits Zarzi compound. When a sniper dinged a CIA operations officer, when a mortar shell or an RPG detonated with far too much accuracy to be a random shot, when an Afghan liaison officer was found with his throat cut, all the signs pointed to the Beheader, who was in all other respects a wonderful man; a charmer; a handsome, well-educated fellow (Oxford, University of Iowa) with impeccable table manners who, when he allowed Americans, including high-ranking marine officers, into his home, boldly violated Islamic taboo by designating a liquor room, where a superb bartender made any drink you could imagine served under a little paper umbrella.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want this guy dead&#x2019;r &#x2019;n shit,&#x201d; said the colonel. &#x201c;I had to fight command and the Agency to get a kill authorized. Ray, I&#x2019;d love to push the button and watch the computer kids whack him, but it&#x2019;s not going to happen. You&#x2019;ve got to walk in, drop him with a rifle shot, and walk out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; said Ray.<br> <br>The shooting site had to be the roof of the Many Pleasures Hotel, across the street from the Beheader&#x2019;s compound. Once a week, the man was predictable. At twilight on Tuesday&#x2014;it was always Tuesday&#x2014;he left the compound by armored Humvee and went into the Houri district, where he visited a nice young prostitute named Mindi, with eyes like almonds, hair the color of night, and ways and means beyond the imagination. And why didn&#x2019;t he just move her in? Well, concubine politics. He had three wives and twenty-one kids, and already wives number one and three hated each other; his second concubine was plotting against his first concubine; all the women were lobbying incessantly for a trip to Beverly Hills; and what little domestic tranquility that could be had would be shattered by adding Mindi to the mix. Thus it was felt that not only her sexual skills but the fact that she was deaf and dumb gave the Great Man a peace and serenity unavailable in his own hectic home.<br> <br>In any event, Tuesday at twilight, he predictably strode from his house to the vehicle, a distance of some ten yards. It was then and only then that he was vulnerable to a shot. Shooting suppressed from a little over 200 yards out, with just enough angle to clear the wall but still access the target, Ray could easily put a Chinese sniper bullet into the Beheader in his five-second window of opportunity. Chaos would ensue, and the militiamen in the bodyguard squad would have no idea where the shot had come from and would certainly begin firing wildly, driving people to cover. Ray and his spotter would fall back from the Many Pleasures Hotel, rappelling off the roof and making their way into the crowded Houri district, just a few blocks away, where they would go to ground. They&#x2019;d just be two more faceless, bearded Izzies in a city full to bursting with them. The next night, they&#x2019;d exfiltrate the city, make it to a certain hill about five miles to the south, and wait for the Night Stalker to come pick them up.<br> <br>&#x201c;It sounds easy,&#x201d; said S-2. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the first day, he and Skelton had passed a couple of Taliban patrols on the high track but attracted no interest from those wary fighters, whose gimlet eyes were used to piercing the distance for the sand-and-spinach digital camo of marine war fighters. The Tallys saw goatherders all the time, and if these two were a little more raggedy ass than most they saw, it didn&#x2019;t register. They moved at goat pace, without urgency, without apparent direction, letting the wiry little animals eat, shit, and fuck as their goat brains saw fit, but generally moseying in the direction of the big market at Qalat where their thirty-five treasures could be sold for slaughter.<br> <br>As part of their security procedure, Whiskey 2-2 avoided villages, slept without campfires, ate rice balls and unleavened sheaves of dry bread, and wiped their hands on their pants and shat without toilet paper.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just like the Sigma Chi house,&#x201d; said Lance Corporal Skelton as they came to the top of a rise and found a tricky path down the other side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Except you don&#x2019;t jack off as much,&#x201d; said Ray.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about you, Ray, but I don&#x2019;t need to jack off much. I had a real nice time with that blond goat last night. She&#x2019;s a princess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Next time, keep it down. May be bad guys in the vicinity.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She sure does moan, doesn&#x2019;t she? Boy, do I know how to please a gal or what?&#x201d;<br> <br>The two men laughed. Lance Corporal Skelton didn&#x2019;t have a Chinese sniper rifle under his robes and vests, but he did have ten pounds of HF-90M Ultralight radio, an M4 with ACOG, ten magazines, and a case containing a Schmidt &amp; Bender 35� spotting scope. All that shit: he moved like an old lady.<br> <br>They were in high plains country, trending north. The Paki mountains rose ahead, over the unseen border, mantled in snow and sometimes fog, more tribal territory where Americans couldn&#x2019;t go for fear of execution upon apprehension. The land they negotiated was rocky and hardscrabble, clotted with waxy, tough, gray vegetation. Rocks lay everywhere, and each hill revealed a new landscape of secret inclines and defilades, and it was all brown-gray, coated with dust or grit. They were right on the border between the rising plains and the actual foothills, and out here it was desolate. Except of course they knew they were being watched and always assumed some Taliban was gazing their way through the scope of a Dragunov or a nice pair of Russian binoculars. So no American-jock crap as young athletic fellows are wont to do, no air jump shots or long, deep fantasy passes; no scooping up the hot grounder and firing to first. No middle fingers, no mock-comic &#x201c;Fuck yous,&#x201d; no hyperattention to hygiene, no acknowledgment that such things as germs existed or that Allah was less than supreme. Prayer mats, five times a day on the knees to Mecca; you never knew who was watching.<br> <br>And, of course, somewhere up above lurked either a satellite or more likely a Predator drone configured for recon and riding the breezes back and forth behind a tiny turbocharged engine, so they were probably on monitors in living color in every intelligence agency in the free world. It was like being on Jay Leno, except for the Afghanistan part. So another sniper discipline was: don&#x2019;t look up. Don&#x2019;t look at the sky, as if to acknowledge that somebody was up there to watch over them.</p><h2>Juicing, Fasting, and Detoxing for Life: Unleash the Healing Power of Fresh Juices and Cleansing Diets</h2><p>Did you know the secret to vibrant health is in your blender? It's true--juicing vegetables provides concentrated nutrition that is found in virtually no other source: vitamins, minerals, enzymes, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. By juicing, you'll feel better, more energized, and improve your immune system. <br> More than a simple collection of recipes, this book guides readers toward a lifestyle that promotes alkaline balance by juicing, eating well, and cleansing the body and soul. While most juicing books focus too much on fruit juice (which disrupts the body's pH balance with too much natural sugar), this book primarily focuses on juices, smoothies and soups made from vegetables. It also also offers a guide to the food richest in nutrients from Vitamin A to zinc and includes various cleanses to benefit the colon, liver, gall bladder, and kidney and more. Beyond the body, the Caboms explain the heavy toll emotional, mental, and spiritual unrest can take on the body (and sometimes even encourage disease) and share unique, effective methods for cleansing the body of such toxicity.</p><p>Cherie Calbom, M.S. is a registered nutritionist.

But modern readers often miss the full literal and figurative meaning of biblical imagery due to the distance in time and experience between the world of today and the world of the Bible. This fully illustrated guide aims to restore clarity and vitality to these portions of God's Word in order to help readers grasp the full meaning of Scripture. For example, the entry on anointing defines the nature of this act and the connotations associated with it before illustrating how the biblical authors use the act of anointing in their communication with us--communication that reaches its full maturity in Jesus, the Anointed One. Understanding manners and customs like anointing enriches our experience of reading the Bible--and even helps us correctly interpret it.<br><br>This colorful guide clearly and succinctly introduces modern readers to daily life in Bible times. The cultural practices of the past are fascinating on their own, but even more so as they help us grasp the full meaning of Scripture.</p><p><b>What was life really like in Bible times?<br></b><br>When we read the Bible, we encounter many manners and customs from the ancient world that the first readers of the Scriptures would have been familiar with.

But now, their very identity and role as a fighting force may be forever changed... <br><br>Until the war in Iraq, Special Forces were the military&#x2019;s counterinsurgency experts. Their specialty was going behind enemy lines and training insurgent forces. In Afghanistan, they toppled the Taliban by transforming Northern Alliance fighters into cohesive units. <br><br>But in the almost nine years since, Special Forces units have forgone their previous mission, instead focusing on offensive raids. With time running short, the Green Berets are going back to their roots and have started to focus on training Afghan security forces and building an Afghan government one village at a time. <br><br>Award-winning journalist Kevin Maurer traveled with a Special Forces team in Afghanistan, finding out first hand the inside story of the lives of this elite group of highly trained soldiers. He witnessed the intense brotherhood built upon the Special Forces&#x2019; rigorous selection process and arduous training that makes them the smartest soldiers on the battlefield. He also discovered the boredom of chasing an elusive enemy and managing third world cops and the infighting between teammates and other units. <br><br>Nine years after the start of the Afghan war, Maurer delivers a compelling account of modern warfare and of a fighting force that is doing everything in its power to achieve victory on a complex twenty-first century battlefield.</p><p><b>Kevin Maurer </b>is an award-winning reporter who has covered special operations forces for seven years.

Chick Bowdrie. He could have ridden the outlaw trail, but the Texas Rangers recruited him because they didn&#39;t want to have to fight against him. Pursuing the most wanted men in the Southwest he knew all too well the dusty trails, the bitter cattle feuds, the desperate killers and the quiet, weather-beaten, wind-blasted towns that could explode into actions with the wrong word. He had sworn to carry out the law, but there were times when he had to apply justice with his fists and his guns. They called in the Rangers to handle the tough ones and there was never a Ranger tougher or smarter than Bowdrie.</p><p>Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier. There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.BOWDRIE RIDES A COYOTE TRAIL<br><br>Only a moment before, Chick Bowdrie had been dozing in the saddle, weary from the long miles behind; then a sudden tensing of muscles of the hammerheaded roan brought him out of it.<br><br>Pulling the black �flat-�crowned hat lower over his eyes, he studied the terrain with the eyes of a man who looked that he might live. His legs, sensitive to every reaction of the horse he rode, had warned him. If he needed more, he had only to look at the roan&#x2019;s ears, tipped forward now, and the flaring nostrils. Whatever it was, the roan did not like it.<br><br>�Soft-�footing it along the dusty trail, he approached the grove of trees with wary attention. He let his right hand drop back to loosen the thong that held his �six-�gun in place on the long rides. There was no change in expression on the dark, �Apache-�like face except that the scar under his right cheekbone seemed to deepen and his eyes grew more intent.<br><br>The trail he followed led along the base of a rocky ridge scattered with trees and boulders broken off from the crest of the ridge and toppled down the slope. The strawberry roan, stepping daintily, walked into the trees.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold it, boy.&#x201d; He spoke gently as he brought the horse to a stand. A few yards away lay the sprawled figure of a man.<br><br>He sat his horse, his eyes sweeping the area with the attention of one who knows he may have to testify in court and would certainly have to file an account of his discovery.<br><br>The man beside the trail was dead. No examination was required to demonstrate that. No man could take a bullet where he had taken this one without dying. Also, he was lying on his back with the sun in his eyes.<br><br>No tracks showed near the body except those of the dead man&#x2019;s horse, which stood nearby. From the size of the hole in the dead man&#x2019;s chest, the bullet had gone in from behind. Bowdrie turned in the saddle, measuring the distance, and his eyes found a large �brush-�covered boulder some fifty yards away.<br><br>The killer had not taken any chances. Chick still sat his horse. The killer had been smart to take no risks, as the man on the ground was no pilgrim. His was a �good-�looking face but one showing grim strength and the seasoning of many suns and the winds from long trails. He also wore two guns, and there were not many who did.<br><br>Bowdrie walked his horse closer, careful to disturb no tracks. He noted the chain loops hanging from the strap button of the dead man&#x2019;s spurs, looking from them to the horse, taking in the ornate Santa Barbara bit and the elaborate �hand-�tooled tapaderos that hooded his stirrups.<br><br>&#x201c;California,&#x201d; Bowdrie said aloud. &#x201c;He came a long way to get killed.&#x201d;<br><br>Dismounting, he walked over to the horse. It shied a bit, but when he spoke it hesitated, then reached for him with its nose, cautious but friendly.<br><br>&#x201c;Your rider,&#x201d; Chick told himself, &#x201c;must have been all right. You certainly haven&#x2019;t been abused.&#x201d;<br><br>He scratched the horse on the neck, his eyes taking in all the details. The rawhide riata suspended from a loop near the pommel attracted his attention.<br><br>&#x201c;Eighty or �eighty-�five feet, I&#x2019;ll bet! I&#x2019;ve heard of ropes like that. California, you were a hand!&#x201d;<br><br>Texas riders stuck to hair ropes �thirty-�five to forty feet long and they worked close to a steer before making a toss. It needed an artist to handle such a rope, but he had heard talk of the California vaqueros who used ropes this long.<br><br>Walking over to the dead man, he went through his pockets. Dust was heavy on the man&#x2019;s clothing. He showed evidence, as did his horse, of riding far and fast. The horse was a tall black, heavier than most Texas cow horses, and was obviously �well-�bred and carefully trained. He was a horse who could stand long miles of hard riding, and by the looks of him he had done just that.<br><br>&#x201c;Riding to see somebody,&#x201d; Chick guessed, &#x201c;because from the look of you, you never ran from anything.&#x201d;<br><br>Making a neat pack of the man&#x2019;s pocket belongings, Chick tucked them into a hip pocket. Then he took the dead man&#x2019;s guns and hung them from his saddle horn.<br><br>The nearest town was too far away to carry a body, and there would be coyotes.<br><br>&#x201c;I mean the �four-�legged kind.&#x201d; Bowdrie, like many a long riding man, often talked to himself. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already run into the �two-�legged kind.&#x201d;<br><br>He found a shallow place where the ground was not too hard, dug it out a little with a stick, and laid the body neatly in the trough he hollowed. Covering the rider&#x2019;s face with his vest, Chick scraped dirt over him, caved more from the bank above, then piled on juniper boughs and rocks.<br><br>When he swung to the saddle again he was leading the black horse. Starting away, he took a route that led past the �brush-�covered boulder.<br><br>A minute and painstaking examination told him little. He was about to leave when he saw the place where the killer&#x2019;s horse had been tethered. Something caught his eye and he studied the rough side of the rock, scowling thoughtfully.<br><br>The horse had waited for some time, judging by the hoof marks, and evidently had tried to scratch himself on the rock.<br><br>Bowdrie gathered several tiny fragments of wood from the rough surface. Dry and hard on one side, they were fresh and unweathered on the other. Carefully he picked off several of the bits of wood, scarcely more than shreds, and put them in a cigarette paper.<br><br>Hours later, when the shadows reached out over the little town of Hacker, Chick Bowdrie ambled the roan down the town&#x2019;s dusty main street to the livery stable. The black trotted behind.<br><br>Sitting in a chair tipped back against the outer wall of a saloon was a man who watched his arrival with some attention. As Bowdrie pulled up at the livery stable the man turned his head and apparently spoke to someone inside. A moment later the doors pushed wide and a man in a white hat stepped out and looked to where Bowdrie was stepping down from his horse.<br><br>Stabling the horses, Chick rubbed them down with care, fed and watered them himself. A �stable-�hand, chewing methodically, strolled over and watched without comment.<br><br>&#x201c;Come far?&#x201d; he asked, finally.<br><br>&#x201c;Quite a piece. What&#x2019;s doin&#x2019; around town?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothin&#x2019; much.&#x201d; The hostler looked at Chick&#x2019;s lean, hard face and the two guns. &#x201c;Huntin&#x2019; a job?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Could be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Herman an&#x2019; Howells are hirin&#x2019;. If a man&#x2019;s handy with a �six-�shooter it won&#x2019;t hurt none.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s two sides to a fight. What about the other?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jack Darcy. Pitchfork outfit. Young sprout, but he ain&#x2019;t hirin&#x2019; gunhands. He&#x2019;s got no money.&#x201d;<br><br>The �stable-�hand&#x2019;s eyes went to the black. &#x201c;You usually carry two horses?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s handy sometimes.&#x201d; Chick straightened and his black eyes looked into the �stable-�hand&#x2019;s blue eyes. &#x201c;You askin&#x2019; for yourself or gettin&#x2019; news for somebody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just askin&#x2019;.&#x201d; He indicated the black horse. &#x201c;You look to be a Texas man but that ain&#x2019;t no Texas outfit.&#x201d;<br><br>Chick smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll give you something to keep you from sleepin&#x2019; too sound. Somethin&#x2019; to think about, Rainy.&#x201d;<br><br>Astonished, the �stable-�hand stared at him. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you know my name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pays a man to keep his eyes open, Rainy,&#x201d; Chick replied. &#x201c;When I rode up, you were diggin&#x2019; tobacco out of your pouch. Your name&#x2019;s burned on it.&#x201d;<br><br>The �stable-�hand was embarrassed. &#x201c;Why, sure! I forget sometimes it&#x2019;s there.&#x201d;<br><br>Bowdrie walked up the street, estimating the town. Quiet, �weather-�beaten, and �wind-�blasted, a few horses at the hitching rails, a stray dog or two, and a �half-�dozen saloons, a few stores. Only the saloons, a caf�, and the hotel showed lights in a town deceptively dead. He had seen many such towns before. A wrong word and they could explode into action.<br><br>The killing on the trail and the fact that at least one outfit was hiring gunhands meant there was more than was easily visible.<br><br>After booking a room at the �two-�story frame hotel, he went to the caf�. Ordering, he sat at a long wooden table and ate in silence. The slatternly woman who served him manifested no interest in the silent, �leather-� faced young man with the twin guns. She had seen them come and go and helped prepare a few for burial after they were gone.<br><br>He ate thoughtfully, turning over in his mind the problem that brought him here. Somewhere in the town of Hacker was a �cow-�stealing killer known as Carl Dyson. He was wanted in Texas for murder. Chick Bowdrie had been working out the man&#x2019;s carefully concealed trail for nearly a month.<br><br>He was sitting over his coffee when Rainy came in, slumping into a seat across the table. He had no more expression than Bowdrie. Picking up the pot, he poured a cup of coffee, black and strong.<br><br>&#x201c;Couple of gents lookin&#x2019; your gear over,&#x201d; he said without looking up. &#x201c;Figured you might like to know. One of them is Russ Peters, a gunhand for the H&amp;H outfit. The other was Murray Roberts, who ramrods for the H&amp;H.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Chick pushed back from the table. &#x201c;Where do they hang out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wagon Wheel Saloon, mostly. A couple of side�winders, mister. Better watch yourself.&#x201d; Rainy&#x2019;s �range-� wise eyes dropped to the guns in their worn holsters as the stranger went out the door. &#x201c;Or,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;maybe they&#x2019;d better watch out!&#x201d;<br><br>Several poker games were in progress in the Wagon Wheel, a few punchers were casually bucking a faro layout, and four men stood at the bar. One was a tall, �fine-� looking man in a white hat and neat range clothes. The other was shorter, heavier, and roughly dressed, with a brutal, unshaved face and a mustache. He wore a �low-� crowned sombrero with a crease through the �middle.<br><br>He muttered something to his companion as Bowdrie came to the bar, but the bigger man merely shot a glance at Chick and went on talking.<br><br>&#x201c;Darcy better sell while the sellin&#x2019; is possible. At this rate he won&#x2019;t have anything left.&#x201d;<br><br>The man with the creased sombrero stared at Chick. &#x201c;Right nice horse you led into town,&#x201d; he commented, &#x201c;and a good many of us are wondering what became of its rider.&#x201d;<br><br>Chick turned slowly. His left elbow rested on the bar; his right hand held a glass of rye. He stared into the yellow eyes of the man in the creased sombrero, and somebody in the room swallowed audibly. Menace seemed to rise like a cloud in the �smoke-�laden air of the room.<br><br>Bowdrie&#x2019;s Apache face did not change. He lifted his glass and drank the rye, putting the glass back on the bar. Tension in the room was a living thing, and the studied moves of the young man at the bar awakened something in the minds of the onlookers.</p><h2>SEVEN FOR A SECRET</h2><p>A newcomer in Wiltshire, Frederica Hammond quickly befriends Rachel Grey and Tamarisk St. Aubyn, and together the three girls grow to adulthood and fall for handsome Gaston Marchmont. 100,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.

Despite this emphasis, other techniques, such as joint locks, throws and leg sweeps, are also included in the system. Karate is one of the few martial arts to contain such a wide range of techniques. </p><p> This book is aimed at the student of shotokan karate. There are many styles of karate, for example, goju-ryu, wado-ryu and shito-ryu, but ultimately each style of karate teaches the same principles, just with a different emphasis. A punch is still a punch, a kick is still a kick. </p><p> <i>The Shotokan Karate Bible</i> is intended to be a guide for the karate student, from beginner right through to expert, when you would be tested to receive the coveted black belt. Studying from a book is no substitute for a good teacher, but it can complement training with a qualified instructor. </p><p> Written in kanji, Japanese pictographs, the word karate is composed of two characters. The first, pronounced kara, means 'empty' and has Zen connotations. The second pictograph, pronounced te, means 'hand,' so karate can be translated as 'empty hand.' </p><p> The kara symbol is thought to have its origins in the Buddhist sunyata, the Sanskrit term for the ancient metaphysical concept of emptiness or nothingness. Gichin Funakoshi, the father of modern karate, wrote:</p> <blockquote><p> As a mirrors polished surface reflects whatever stands before it and a quiet valley carries even small sounds, so must the student of Karate-Do render their mind empty of selfishness and wickedness in an effort to react appropriately toward anything they might encounter. This is the meaning of the kara or 'empty' of Karate-Do. </p></blockquote><p> Funakoshi is saying that you need to empty your mind in order to take the most appropriate action. He is implying that the appropriate action is the righteous and moral thing to do. However, many take it to mean the correct action to take in order to succeed in a fight. If you clutter your mind, you can't think clearly. Thus, an empty mind is needed to practice good karate. </p><p> This, however, is not the original meaning of karate. The original pictograph for kara was quite different. In Japanese, it was a homonym: that's to say, it was pronounced in the same way, but it had a different meaning. It meant Tang, which was a Chinese imperial dynasty at the zenith of Chinese civilization that had a huge cultural influence on its neighbors. Tang was synonymous with China, and the original karate pictographs meant 'Chinese hand.' In Okinawa, the same two pictographs were pronounced tode, and many in Okinawa referred to them simply as te, meaning hand. </p><p> This change from the old ideographs for karate to the new occurred at the beginning of the 20th century. Japan was very nationalistic at this time, and for many, the association of the old symbol with China was not acceptable. Some karate schools, particularly in Tokyo, began writing karate with hiragana, Japanese phonetic characters, as a way of avoiding the 'inappropriate' kanji with its Chinese connotation. Others had started writing 'empty hand' using the new symbol for kara. At a meeting of Okinawan karate masters in 1936, the new way of writing karate was officially accepted. </p></p><h2>The Arrows Cookbook: Cooking and Gardening from Maine&#39;s Most Beautiful Farmhouse Restaurant</h2><p>Combines 160 recipes and advice on how to grow vegetables, fruits, and herbs in a volume by the seasonal Arrows restaurant chefs that includes instructions on how to build an herb box, select heirloom tomatoes, roast salmon on a cedar plank, and more. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Located in Ogunquit, Maine, Arrows is a country restaurant owned by Clark Fraiser and Mark Gaier, who are also its chefs. <i>The Arrows Cookbook</i>, written by the pair, offers 150 recipes from the dining spot, contemporary food like Plank-Roasted Salmon with Rosemary-Mustard Vinaigrette, Baby Bok Choy with Chives and Smoked Ham, and Grilled Sea Scallops with Chile Pepper Sauce. These attractive, uncomplicated dishes are suitable for company or "dressier" weeknight cooking. What sets the book apart from similar works is its attention to the "backyard" garden that supplies the restaurant with over 250 varieties of fresh seasonal produce. The authors' garden smarts yields useful advice, including "How to Build Herb Boxes," "14 Easy Seeds," and "Heirloom Gardening."<p> The authors make a larger point. "You don't have to believe in the cosmic wisdom of cooking from the garden," they say. "It's enough that your garden will make you smarter about food." Cooking seasonally from the garden "has kept our culinary experimentation firmly rooted," they add, "and will do the same for you." The message is born out by the book's organization, which presents dishes--soup to desserts--season by the season. The winter section, for example, begins with a brief description of Arrows's cold-weather life ("Hardy herbs like sage, rosemary, and thyme are still thriving in our garden beds at Thanksgiving...") then offers appropriate fare including Maine Shrimp Dumplings with Cilantro, Boiled Dinner Our Way (a particularly good version of the traditional dish), and Kale, Swiss Cheese, and Bacon Casserole. "Winter" desserts consist of the tempting likes of Steamed Pumpkin Pudding with Vanilla Cr�me Anglaise and Chocolate Carrot Cake with Chocolate-Sour Cream Frosting. As both cooking and gardening guide, the book occupies a special--and engaging--spot. With color photos plus line drawings that particularly capture Arrows' special spirit. <i>&#x2013;-Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>Clark Frasier</b> grew up in Carmel, California.

The King, his retinue and anyone with sufficient means has fled the plague-ridden city, its half-deserted streets echoing to the sound of bells tolling the mounting number of deaths. Those who remain clutch doubtful potions to ward off the relentless disease and dart nervously past shuttered buildings, watchful for the thieves who risk their lives to plunder what has been left behind.</p><p>At Chelsea, a rural backwater by the river, with fine mansions leased to minor members of the Court avoiding the capital, there are more immediate concerns: the government has commandeered the theological college to house Dutch prisoners of war and there are daily rumours that those sailors are on the brink of escaping. Moreover, a vicious strangler is stalking the neighbourhood.</p><p>Thomas Chaloner is sent to investigate the murder of the first victim, an inmate of a private sanatorium known as Gorges. There have been thefts there as well, but the few facts he gleans from inmates and staff are contradictory and elusive. He realises, though, that Gorges has stronger links to the prison than just proximity, and that the influx of strangers offers plenty of camouflage for a killer - a killer who has no compunction about turning on those determined to stop his murderous rampage.</p></p><p><p>Susanna Gregory was a police officer in Leeds before taking up an academic career.

These essays on Jeremiah exemplify his insistence that criticism should lead to interpretation, and remind us again why prophets like Jeremiah still matter in the 21st century.&#34; - John J. Collins, Holmes Professor of Old Testament, Yale &#34;Like Fire in the Bones is a gift to the churches and to anyone interested in prophetic literature with its harsh rhetoric, blazing visions, and demanding yet merciful God. Jeremiah may have had fire in his bones, but Brueggemann sets fires with his pen. He shows how Jeremiah speaks into the abyss of historical catastrophe with speech that matches experience. He underlines the disputatious political character of theological speech. He reiterates Jeremiah&#39;s call to covenant loyalty even in the face of religious and government forces that suppress and silence words of life. He illuminates Jeremiah&#39;s bare-boned hope for a world in the thrall of empire and social amnesia. If ever there was need for imaginative rereading of Jeremiah and of the texts of common life, it is now. At this, Brueggemann is a master.&#34; - Kathleen M. O&#39;Connor, William Marcellus McPheeters Professor of Old Testament, Columbia Theological Seminary &#34;Jeremiah, the longest book in the Bible, is neglected much too often by preacher and teacher alike. That neglect is due, in significant part, to the prophet&#39;s often-sharp words that strike too close to home, in his own generation and in ours. It is telling that the prophet Jeremiah, the focus of these essays that span much of Walter Brueggemann&#39;s prophetic ministry, has been in his head and heart for such a long time. Again and again, Brueggemann&#39;s own words have mirrored Jeremiah to us, and the times in which we presently live could profit from hearing them again.&#34; - Terence E. Fretheim, Elva B.

Nor did African men and women, brought to the Americas as slaves. Though it would be hard to tell from the historical record, European colonists and African slaves had children, as did the indigenous families whom they encountered, and those children's life experiences enrich and complicate our understanding of colonial America.<br>Through essays, primary documents, and contemporary illustrations, Children in Colonial America examines the unique aspects of childhood in the American colonies between the late sixteenth and late eighteenth centuries. The twelve original essays observe a diverse cross-section of children&#x2014;from indigenous peoples of the east coast and Mexico to Dutch-born children of the Plymouth colony and African-born offspring of slaves in the Caribbean&#x2014;and explore themes including parenting and childrearing practices, children's health and education, sibling relations, child abuse, mental health, gender, play, and rites of passage.<br>Taken together, the essays and documents in Children in Colonial America shed light on the ways in which the process of colonization shaped childhood, and in turn how the experience of children affected life in colonial America.</p></p><p><b>James Marten</b> is Professor and Chair of the History Department at Marquette University.

Who doesn&#x2019;t know the brisk purpose of a sparrow, the airy insouciance of the seagull, the dramatic power of the hawk? Birds are beautiful, you can encounter them anywhere, and they embody one of the primal human aspirations: flight.<br><br>Birdwatching starts, simply, with a habit of looking. You let birds into your life a little at a time. You remember bird names as you would the names of people you&#x2019;ve enjoyed meeting. And if you share your looking and listening with other people, so much the better. Birdwatching might even help you get along with the father who never approved of anything you did&#x2014;as it did for Barnes.<br><br>As Barnes shares his relaxed principles of birdwatching, he also shows us the power of place: the elation of spotting kingfishers in Kashmir, hawks over the Great Lakes, or the birds closest to home. And he shows how, no matter where you live, birds can connect you to the greater glory of life.<br><br>Funny, enthusiastic, and inspiring, <i>How to Be a Bad Birdwatcher</i> demonstrates why you don&#x2019;t have to have fancy binoculars or lifetime checklists to discover a new world.

With the carmine bee-eaters of the Luangwa Valley in Zambia? With the rhinoceros hornbill glimpsed through a gap in the canopy in the rain forests of Borneo? Or with the crested oropendola seen from the press box at the Queen's Park cricket ground in Trinidad (when I was being paid to watch Ian Botham)?<br><br>No. Let's start in Barnet, on the extreme edge of London. I used to live there. I was going into the center of London to meet someone, perhaps even to do some work. I wasn't looking for birds. I hadn't even got binoculars; you can't use them in a London pub, not without attracting adverse comment, anyway.<br><br>I wasn't looking for birds, but I am always looking at them, you see. Not for reasons of science, or in hopes of a fabulous rarity, or to make careful observations of seasonal behavior. Just because looking at birds is one of life's greatest pleasures. Looking at birds is a key: it opens doors, and if you choose to go through them you find you enjoy life more and understand life better.<br><br>It was a nice day of early summer, the kind of day when a chap's eyes keep turning to the girls who have molted into their skimpy summer plumage and men wear their jackets on their thumbs. And because it was such a nice day, I thought I'd walk past the common to Hadley Wood train station rather than through the High Street to High Barnet tube. It turned out to be one of my better decisions.<br><br>I was going through Monken Hadley churchyard to catch a train that would get me to Oxford Circus (change at Highbury and Islington) in forty minutes. And there were lots (note scientific precision) of house martins whizzing round and round the church tower.<br><br>House martins are related to American purple martins. Both are related to barn swallows, which appear on both sides of the Atlantic. House martins are jaunty and swallow-like and, if you are lucky, they nest under the eaves of your house and leave aromatic trails down the wall and bring joy to your heart on the rare day in spring when they return from their travels.<br><br>They are dapper little chaps, navy blue with white bums, and they are one of the sights and sounds of the English summer, doing things like whizzing round church steeples and catching flies in their beaks. Later in the season the young ones take up whizzing themselves, trying to get the hang of this flying business. I always imagine the martin mother saying: Well done, little one. You flew three times round the church tower. Now you've got another flight to try. Cape Town.<br><br>Where was I? Monken Hadley church, pausing on my journey to Oxford Street to spend a few moments gazing at the whirligig of martins. It was nothing special, nothing exceptional, and it was very good indeed. Note this: one of the great pleasures of birdwatching is the quiet enjoyment of the absolutely ordinary.<br><br>And then it happened. Bam!<br><br>Gone.<br><br> From the tail of my eye, I saw what I took to be a kestrel. I turned my head to watch it as it climbed, and I waited for it to go into its hover, according to time-honored kestrel custom. But it did nothing of the kind. It turned itself into an anchor, or the Greek letter psi. Or a thunderbolt.<br><br>No kestrel this: it crashed into the crowd of martins like the wrath of God, and almost as swiftly vanished. I think it got one, but I can't swear to it, it was all so fast. And there I was down on the pavement with a bag full of books on my back, uttering incredulous obscenities and prayerful blasphemies. What the hell was that?<br><br>It was a hobby. Perhaps the most dashing falcon of them all: slim, elegant, and deadly fast. Not rare as rare-bird addicts reckon things; they come to Britain in reasonable numbers every summer to breed. The sight of a hobby makes no headlines in the birdwatching world. It was just a wonderful and wholly unexpected sight of a wonderful and wholly unexpected bird. It was a moment of perfect drama. Note this: one of the great pleasures of birdwatching is the moments of peak experience.<br><br>We humans tend to simultaneous and mutually exclusive desires: to be married, to be single; to be social, to be alone; to travel adventurously, to stay at home. Birdwatching embraces both halves of our natural desire for contradiction. It brings us enhanced enjoyment of the ordinary, the easy, and the safe, and it brings us moments of high drama and gratification and dangerous delight.<br><br>Rather like life, really. And that is what bad birdwatching is all about. Life, that is to say.<br>Let's go back to that hobby, and those martins. How much skill was required? How much knowledge? How much scientific background? None, none, and none. The martins were just there, being obvious and making their merry farting calls to on another: one of the great ambient birds of the English summer. Everyone in Britain has seen martins, just as everyone on both sides of the Atlantic has seen barn swallows, even if he can't put a name to them.<br><br>And the hobby was unmissable, unmistakable: a great black (I saw him only in silhouette) force. It wasn't necessary to identify the bird, to know it by name; it was enough to witness a fierce and terrible drama. Any bad birdwatcher would know it was a bird of prey, and any human being would have known it was something dreadful. Knowing its name was a luxury. It wasn't exciting because it was rare and because I could call it Falco subbuteo and because I could tick it and boast about it. It was exciting because it was a thrilling bird in a thrilling moment.<br><br>Now, I am lying here just a bit. Knowing that the bird was a hobby was a formal completion of the business. It was an explanation, a key to the drama. That is what hobbies do, you see: they turn into anchors or psis and make sudden lacerating dives into flocks of circling martins. It was gratifying to have the explanation, the understanding.<br><br>But before the understanding comes the wonder. Comes the delight. And that is the first aim of being a bad birdwatcher: the calm delight of the utterly normal, and the rare and sudden delight of the utterly unexpected.<br><br>The only real skill involved in this perfect birdwatching moment was the willingness to look. It was not skill that gave me the sight; it was habit. I have developed the habit of looking: when I see a bird I always look, wherever I am. It is no longer a conscious decision. I might be in the middle of a conversation of amazing importance about the Direction of Our Marriage, but my eye will flick out of the window at a hint of movement, caught in the tail of my eye, and I will register: bloody hell, sparrowhawk. I might say it aloud, too--not necessarily a wise decision.<br><br>I once found a questionnaire in a birdwatching magazine. It asked: "How often do you go birdwatching?" I reject the question out of hand. I don't go birdwatching. I am birdwatching. Birdwatching is a state of being, not an activity. It doesn't depend on place, on equipment, on specific purpose, like, say, fishing. It is not a matter of organic train-spotting; it is about life and it is about living.<br><br>It is a matter of keeping the eyes and ears and mind open. It is not a matter of obsession, not at all. It is just quiet enjoyment. A happy married man will still glance at pretty girls and appreciate their loveliness without the need to do anything about it. It is just a habit of heterosexual males to look, and it is one that adds to the gaiety of life.<br><br>A car nut will make a quiet, unthinking appraisal of every vehicle he sees; it is part of the way his mind works. He will hardly be aware that he is doing it, unless his glance is caught by something exceptional. The habit is not something to do with what he does; it is something to do with what he is.<br><br>And that is what being a bad birdwatcher is all about. It is just the habit of looking. Born-againers talk about Bringing Jesus into Your Life; this book is an invitation to bring birds into your life. To the greater glory of life.<br><b>TWO</b><br><b>Hamlet was a bad birdwatcher</b><br><br>Perhaps you know nothing at all about birds. Perhaps you even say it: Well, me, I know nothing at all about birds. If so, you are lying through your teeth. It is impossible to know nothing at all about birds. Trust me: you can identify several different kinds of birds. Let's compile a list of birds that you can already recognize--even if you call yourself the most ignorant birdwatcher in the land:<br><br>robin<br><br>swan<br><br>duck<br><br>eagle<br><br>swallow<br><br>crow<br><br>sparrow<br><br>seagull<br><br>goose<br><br>pigeon<br><br>That's ten for a start.

And you might as well add a few more:<br><br>bluebird<br><br>wood thrush<br><br>cardinal<br><br>pheasant<br><br>vulture<br><br>hummingbird<br><br>hawk<br><br>blue jay<br><br>chickadee<br><br>You can recognize a woodpecker by ear, when you hear it bashing the hell out of a branch. And of course there are plenty of birds that you can recognize from pictures, without ever being in much danger of seeing: snowy owl (from Harry Potter films), penguin (from the spines of paperback books), and, of course, a Wild Turkey. And you could throw in a few exotics, too: parrot, peacock, toucan, flamingo, pelican, ostrich. True, not all the birds in those two lists are proper species. For example, there are three swan species that you can see in Britain. And please don't be put off when I tell you that there are seventy-four different cuckoo species in the world. But we'll bother with species later. Let us keep things simple and talk about different kinds of birds. A swan is a different kind of bird from a robin; and if you can tell the difference between one kind of bird and another, you have alre...</p><h2>Oley Valley Heritage: The Colonial Years, 1700-1775</h2><p>Author traces the settlement of Oley Valley beginning in 1700 with the development of its economy, church life, and governmental institutions.

To retrace Fallaci's life means to retrace the course of history from World War II to 9/11.<br><br>As a child, Fallaci enlisted herself in the Italian Resistance alongside her father. Her hatred of fascism and authoritarian regimes would accompany her throughout her life. Covering the entertainment industry early on in her career, she created an original, abrasive interview style, focusing on her subject's emotions, contradictions, and facial expressions more than their words. When she grew bored of interviewing movie stars and directors, she turned her attention to the greatest international figures of the time: Khomeini, Gaddafi, Indira Gandhi, and Kissinger, placing herself front and center in the story. Reporting from the front lines of the world's greatest conflicts, she provoked her own controversies wherever she was stationed, leaving behind epic collateral damage in her wake.<br><br>Thanks to unprecedented access to personal records, Cristina De Stefano brings back to life a remarkable woman whose groundbreaking work and torrid love affairs will not soon be forgotten. Oriana Fallaci allows a new generation to discover her story, and witness the passionate, persistent journalism that we urgently need in these times of upheaval and uncertainty.</p><p><b>Cristina De Stefano</b>&nbsp;is a journalist and writer.

Fallaci lives a genuinely romantic life, too, with stormy loves and war wounds.

Americans have always had a complicated relationship with aging: embrace it, deny it, defer it--and women have been on the front lines of the battle, willingly or not. <br><br>In her lively social history of American women and aging, acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> columnist Gail Collins illustrates the ways in which age is an arbitrary concept that has swung back and forth over the centuries. From Plymouth Rock (when a woman was considered marriageable if "civil and under fifty years of age"), to a few generations later, when they were quietly retired to elderdom once they had passed the optimum age for reproduction, to recent decades when freedom from striving in the workplace and caretaking at home is often celebrated, to the first female nominee for president, American attitudes towards age have been a moving target. Gail Collins gives women reason to expect the best of their golden years.</p><p>Gail Collins is a columnist for the <i>New York Times</i>. From 2001-2007 she was editorial page editor of the paper--the first woman to have held that position."A deeply researched, entertaining book . . .

He graduated from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale in 1897, where he was business manager of The Yale Record and a member of Berzelius. In 1900 he was first confined to a private mental institution for depression and paranoia. He would later be confined to another private hospital as well as a state institution.

Beers gained the support of the medical profession and others in the work to reform the treatment of the mentally ill. In 1908 Beers founded the "Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene", now named Mental Health Connecticut. In 1909 Beers founded the "National Committee for Mental Hygiene", now named "Mental Health America", in order to continue the reform for the treatment of the mentally ill. He also started the Clifford Beers Clinic in New Haven in 1913, the first outpatient mental health clinic in the United States.

Reprint.</p><p><b>MARK BERENT</b> served in the Air Force for over twenty years, first as an enlisted man and then as an officer. He has logged 4,350 hours of lying time, over 1,000 of them in combat. During his three Vietnam tours, Berent earned not only the Silver Star, but two Distinguished Flying Crosses, air medals, a Bronze Star, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and Legion of Merit.In this Vietnam-era sequel to Rolling Thunder and Steel Tiger , Berent takes his well-established characters into the period of the Tet Offensive. Fighter pilot Court Bannister and forward air controller Toby Parker are assigned to form a new unit for a new mission: flying high-performance fighters as "fast forward air control" to interdict night movement of supplies and reinforcements down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Special Forces lieutenant-colonel Wolf Lochert continues to fight his war on the ground--much of it against trumped-up charges of murdering an enemy agent. The novel's real antagonists, indeed, are less the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong armed forces than the ignorant politicians and malevolent activists back in the U.S. Berent's flogging of this familiar theme sacrifices impact for repetition. But Berent remains without peer in the battle zone, describing the dynamics of an air war waged in a restrictive environment against a determined enemy. And his stomach-turning--and essentially accurate--depictions of the treatment of American pilots in Vietnamese captivity are timely reminders that there is no such thing as a Nintendo war. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gucci: A House Divided</h2><p>The complete rags-to-riches story of the Gucci family, the Gucci business, and the battles that are tearing them apart draws on interviews with family members, as well as court and company papers and documents</p><p>British journalist McKnight's full-scale account of Guccio Gucci's rags-to-riches story and the lives of his descendants begins with GG as a waiter at London's Savoy Hotel, through the aftermath of World War I, to the opening of the first shop in Florence in 1923.

In addition to writing his own books and for various publications, he runs his family's cattle enterprise in Peyton, Colorado. His first book was critically acclaimed military classic <b>Marine Sniper</b>, which first chronicled the exploits of U.S.M.C. sniper <b>Carlos Hathcock</b>. He is also the author of <b>Marshalling the Faithful</b>.Henderson, a retired Marine Corps officer, first told Hathcock's Vietnam-and-aftermath stories in his highly readable, highly hagiographic Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills (1986), which continues to be a favorite item at the PX. Sniper detailed how U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Carlos J. Hathcock II used his uncanny marksmanship in Vietnam to record more than 300 hits, and how he dragged six of his unconscious buddies away from a burning tank. After an arduous recovery from serious burns received then, Hathcock learned that he had multiple sclerosisAthe disease he succumbed to last year. Henderson frames Warrior by imagining what Hathcock was thinking on his deathbed. Waves of imagined dialogue, based on interviews Henderson conducted with Hathcock and with a raft of witnesses to his heroics, crash through page after page. The voices of former Vietcong and North Vietnamese soldiers, including the late Tran Van Tra, who commanded VC forces in South Vietnam, fill things out, along with Henderson himself. What he and the others say is sure to add to the Hathcock mythos and will thrill buffs and ex- and current servicemen alike. But few other readers will be able to countenance the overheated style and lack of journalistic care in sourcing the story, although Hathcock was doubtless an exemplary soldier. After an initial burst from fans of Sniper, whose sales it will revive, this book will sell steadily but probably less prolifically than its predecessor.

His philological-historical approach calls for a reconsideration of how we read the literary sources. He brings to bear the wealth of new information regarding the first century setting in light of the Dead Sea Scrolls, historical inquiry, and recent archaeological discoveries. What results is a compelling portrait of Jesus which gains additional depth because it is viewed wit&amp; the context of Jewish though and Life in the first century. Both Jewish and Christian readers will be challenged by the results of Flusser's study. The present work is based upon author's 1968 edition of Jesus. Yet, with the passage of 30 years, the new volume has been essentially rewritten to incorporate the wealth of new data. Whereas the previous book, now out of print, represented the beginnings of Flusser's investigation into the historical Jesus, the present volume is its culmination.</p><p>David Flusser is Professor Emeritus at the Hebrew University where he taught Judaism in the Second Temple Period and Early Christianity.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Chimney Pond Tales: Yarns Told by Leroy Dudley</h2><p>MAINE&#39;S MOUNT KATAHDIN, IN THE 1930&#39;S AN EDISON DICTATING MACHING WAS USED AS HE SPOKE INTO WAX CYLINDERS.</p><p></p><h2>What About Me?

The Maestros live in Old Lyme, CT.</p>This ambitious sequel to the Maestros' The Discovery of the Americas begins with a revisionist summation of Christopher Columbus's famous feats: the explorer "was not the first to discover the Americas. But his voyages led to the European exploration of the New World." The book covers more than 130 years of exploration, presenting brief overviews of Magellan, Cortes, Pizarro, Hudson, Drake, Champlain et al. Betsy Maestro also discusses the effects of these incursions on native peoples; she touches upon the African slave trade, the decimation of the Aztec civilization and the general failure of Europeans to honor their agreements with Native Americans. While the writing is clear, the range of information may be too broad for the reader to absorb easily. Each topic receives only a paragraph or two, and important concepts are often reduced to a single sentence. More satisfying is the watercolor-and-pencil art, which vividly depicts the explorers and their exploits. Giulio Maestro captures the essence of his settings-the midnight blues of a nighttime sky at sea, the earthy yellows and browns of the American Southwest, the green, tiered mountains of Central America. Appendixes contain a table of dates; lists of explorers not mentioned in the text; useful summaries; and a list of Native American "contributions to the world."

It is no small irony, historian Ronald Takaki observes, that the armed struggle for democracy abroad "was accompanied by a disregard for our nation's declaration that 'all men are created equal'" in the form of institutional racism of many kinds, from the segregation of African American units to the imprisonment of Japanese Americans and the refusal to grant asylum to Jewish refugees.<p> In <i>Double Victory</i>, Takaki examines the many contributions of America's minorities to the war effort, celebrating the work of Mexican farm laborers and Anglo women welders, of Navajo code talkers and Filipino foot soldiers, who proclaimed themselves to be "men, not houseboys," of Chinese American combat nurses and Asian Indian gunners. These men and women, Takaki writes, made extraordinary sacrifices in their battle against enemies without and enemies within. Although their efforts were not always appreciated at the time, they helped set in motion the struggle for civil rights that would explode two decades later. Takaki's book is a welcome and much needed entry in the recent literature on the World War II era, and it merits the widest possible audience. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#34;My grandfather emigrated from Japan to work on the cane fields of Hawaii in 1886, and my mother was born on the Hawi Plantation. As a teenager growing up on Oahu, I was not academically inclined but was actually a surfer. During my senior year, I took a religion course taught by Dr. Shunji Nishi, a Japanese American with a Ph.D. I remember going home and asking my mother, who only had an eighth-grade education: &#34;Mom, what&#39;s a Ph.D.?&#34; She answered: &#34;I don&#39;t know but he must be very smart.&#34; Dr. Nishi became a role model for me, and he arranged for me to attend the College of Wooster. There my fellow white students asked me questions like: &#34;How long have you been in this county? Where did you learn to speak English?&#34; They did not see me as a fellow American. I did not look white or European in ancestry. As a scholar, I have been seeking to write a more inclusive and hence more accurate history of Americans, Chicanos, Native Americans as well as certain European immigrant groups like the Irish and Jews. My scholarship seeks not to separate our diverse groups but to show how our experiences were different but they were not disparate. Multicultural history, as I write and present it, leads not to what Schlesinger calls the &#34;disuniting of America&#34; but rather to the re-uniting of America.&#34;</p><h2>The Juicing Bible</h2><p><p> For years nutritionists and health practitioners have urged North Americans to eat more fruits and vegetables. Why? Because these foods are low in fat, and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals and fiber. Yet many of us -- even the most health conscious -- still don't consume the recommended 5 to 10 servings a day. </p><p> So what's the solution? For some people, the answer lies in vitamin and herbal supplements, both of which have enjoyed explosive sales growth over the past decade. But recent research suggests that whole, natural foods are still the best source of nutrients. And there's no easier or more effective way to add fresh fruits and vegetables to your diet than by juicing them. </p><p> Now, with <b>The Juicing Bible</b>, there's a new and comprehensive source of information for anyone who wants to explore the health benefits of juicing. Here you'll find a fully illustrated reference documenting the nutritive values and healing properties of over 100 fruits, vegetables and herbs. There's also a special section that addresses 60 common health conditions -- with prescriptive advice for using specific juices, as well as beneficial dietary and lifestyle changes. And, of course, there are the juicing recipes themselves -- over 150 of them, including flavorful juices (sample a Crimson Cleanser or Beta Blast), smoothies (try the Pump It Up or Cool Down), tonics, bitters, coffee substitutes and healing teas. </p><p> With helpful sidebars, health tips and preparation techniques throughout, <b>The Juicing Bible</b> is jam-packed with information. It's a BIG book -- the biggest we've ever published -- and it's an essential guide for anyone who wants to explore all the nutritional benefits that natural foods can provide. </p><p> <b>Why Juice?</b> </p><ul> <li></li>Research has shown that freshly juiced fruits and vegetables contain literally thousands of natural chemicals that simply aren't provided by nutritional or vitamin supplements. These substances, called phytochemicals, are only now being understood; but a number of studies suggest that they play an essential role in ridding the body of potential carcinogens, as well as protecting against cellular damage. <li></li>Fresh juice (unlike commercially prepared juice) contains a number of enzymes, which are essential to the proper function of the human metabolism <li></li>Juicing removes much of the indigestible fiber in fruits and vegetables, which means that a substantially larger amount of available nutrients can be absorbed by the body. One study has shown that a carrot, when juiced, delivers 100 times the beta-carotene of a carrot eaten whole. </ul><p></p></p><p>Winner of &#34;The Best in the World&#34; in the category &#34;The Best Health and Nutrition&#34; at The World Cookbook Fair Awards in Perigueux France on November 11, 2000.

Who would you ask? In this searing collection, Ai does the difficult work of choosing for us. She invites a whole host of often less-than-presentable guests, including presidents ("I have a deep affection for my wife, / but also for sweet, big-haired girls... who never complain of tired jaws"), paparazzi ("I am there for you, / a friend, not an enemy, / stalkerazzi, or a tabloid Nazi"), and prurient priests ("Lord, I crave things"). Elsewhere, Ai gives voice to Lenny Bruce, a grief-stricken Marilyn Monroe, and the spurned lover who confesses "A man could never do / as much for Imelda / as a pair of shoes." Donning the mask of our most famous (and infamous) politicians and celebrities, as well as our most vilified antiheroes, she gives new life to the dramatic monologue. And in poems "by" rapists, murderers, looters, hit men, and stalkers, she puts words in the mouths of the thoroughly muzzled. Like Whitman, she writes from the conviction that every voice--no matter how despicable or seemingly insignificant--deserves the chance to be heard. <i>--Martha Silano</i><i>Vice</i> has been named a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award in Poetry.</p><h2>Daughters of the Winter Queen: Four Remarkable Sisters, the Crown of Bohemia, and the Enduring Legacy of Mary, Queen of Scots</h2><p><b>The thrilling family saga of five unforgettable women who remade Europe</b><br><br>From the great courts, glittering palaces, and war-ravaged battlefields of the seventeenth century comes the story of four spirited sisters and their glamorous mother, Elizabeth Stuart, granddaughter of the martyred Mary, Queen of Scots.<br>Upon her father's ascension to the illustrious throne of England, Elizabeth Stuart was suddenly thrust from the poverty of unruly Scotland into the fairy-tale existence of a princess of great wealth and splendor.

The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin "the Winter Queen," as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. <br>Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher Ren� Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost.

Yet the achievement of a work like this is not merely its command of a vast and dense web of the past, but also its incredible literary merit. <i>Daughters of the Winter Queen </i>is nothing short of page-turning, an exceptional work of scholarship that reads like a favorite novel filled with political intrigue, romantic scandal, and more than one dark-of-night escape."&#x2015;<b><i><i>East Hampton Star</i></i></b><br><br>"A fascinating feminist story."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Coil</i></i></b><br><br>"This rich and complex story of a seventeenth century queen who lost her throne, and her four defiant daughters, is compulsively readable.

For starters, her attitude toward cooking ("the one activity, besides tennis, in which housewives were encouraged to excel") is decidedly ambivalent. A chapter entitled "Attack by Whisk and Cuisinart" paints a devastating portrait of entertaining as a competitive sport, in which women who spend weeks planning and executing elaborate dinner parties must "pretend there'd been no labor, no expense, no fatigue, no sweat ... the aim was to look like a hot tomato while remaining cucumber-cool." For another thing, anyone with Fussell's gift for apt metaphor should enjoy chapters like "To Arms with Squeezer and Slicer," or "Invasion of the Waring Blenders," whose titles wittily encapsulate their content and would be wasted on mere recipes or recollections of Chefs I Have Known. Instead, she limns the experience of a generation of women who flung themselves into domesticity after World War II with mixed results, which in the author's case included an ultimately failed marriage to cultural historian Paul Fussell (who is not treated gently here). Smart, funny, even appetizing at times, her book takes one woman's story as a case study of the role food plays in our lives and in our culture. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Betty Fussell has lectured widely on food and food history and won the 2008 James Beard Award for &#x201c;Magazine Feature Writing with Recipes.&#x201d; She is the author of eleven books, including <i>Masters of American Cookery: M.

Various sections of the three volumes describe the arrest, interrogation, conviction, transportation, and imprisonment of the Gulag's victims by Soviet authorities over four decades. The work mingles historical exposition and Solzhenitsyn's own autobiographical accounts with the voluminous personal testimony of other inmates that he collected and committed to memory during his imprisonment.Upon publication of the first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago, </i> Solzhenitsyn was immediately attacked in the Soviet press. Despite the intense interest in his fate that was shown in the West, he was arrested and charged with treason on February 12, 1974, and was exiled from the Soviet Union the following day.</p><p><b>Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn</b> was born into a family of Cossack intellectuals in Kislovodsk, Russia, in 1918. He fought for the Soviet Union in World War II, achieving the rank of captain of artillery. In 1945 he was arrested for writing a letter in which he criticized Joseph Stalin and spent eight years in prisons and labor camps. In 1956 he was allowed to settle in Ryazan, in central Russia, where he became a mathematics teacher and began to write. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. Following the publication of the first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago, </i> he was exiled in 1974. His Soviet citizenship was restored in 1990 and he returned to Russia in 1994, where he now lives.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Downfall (The Dhamon Saga)</h2><p>Rig and Fiona once again rely on their friend, Dhamon, to save the land of Ansalon from destruction, but they find him so changed that they are not sure if he can save himself.</p><p>It's not easy being Jean. For some Dragonlance fans, the world of Krynn ended with Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's <i>Dragons of Summer Flame</i>. Many Lancers would just as soon forget Jean Rabe's famously awful Fifth Age kickoff trilogy (<i>The Dawning of a New Age</i>, <i>The Day of the Tempest</i>, and <i>The Eve of the Maelstrom</i>), and that's putting it nicely. (Imagine the Comic Book Guy from the <i>Simpsons</i> saying, "Worst fantasy author <i>ever</i>," and you'll begin to understand the enmity that Rabe has generated for herself.)<p> But Weis and Hickman returned triumphantly to the Fifth Age with <i>Dragons of a Fallen Sun</i>, proving that the reports of Krynn's death were, at worst, an exaggeration. So maybe--just maybe--Rabe deserves a fresh start in Dragonlance, too. <i>Downfall</i> begins a trilogy revolving around Dhamon Grimwulf, former Knight of Takhisis, ex-Hero of the Heart, and erstwhile co-protagonist of Rabe's aforementioned Dragons of a New Age series. Dhamon is on the outs, running around robbing the sick and the weak in cahoots with a kobold, a tattooed half-elf floozy, and a suspiciously powerful thief-wizard named Maldred. (Hmmm, there's something fishy about that guy...) In rolls plate-mail babe Fiona (a spit-shined Knight of Solamnia) and pirate-turned-good-guy Rig Mer-Krel, presumably to clean up Dhamon and set him on the straight and narrow. But faster than you can say "Charm Person," the entire crew ends up on the road together, heading off to bargain with an ogre chieftain, rescue a herd of goats, and ransom Fiona's brother from the black dragon overlord Sable. Or so they think. Quite a few switchbacks and blind canyons here, enough to keep you wondering what's around the next corner, but don't expect emotional, involved Weis-and-Hickman fare: while many Dragonlance fans would consider it damning praise, <i>Downfall</i> reads a lot like a decent Forgotten Realms adventure. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p></p><h2>Circle Trilogy Black; Red; White</h2><p>Some say that the world hangs in the balance of our choices. Now, the fate of two worlds depends on one man&#39;s choices...an unlikely hero who may not survive the next twenty-four hours. The adrenaline-laced trilogy began with Black last February, continued with Red in June, and now races to an unbelievable conclusion with White this October. In this book, Thomas Hunter struggles to stave off a war and virus that are simultaneously ravaging two worlds&#39; populations. Meanwhile, he must also contend with the ramifications of an incredible love story that unfolds--consequences that are far more crushing than anyone could ever imagine. This final installment brings the groundbreaking series to a close in a completely unexpected manner, filled with final plot twists that will richly reward those who have taken this epic journey.</p><p></p><h2>The Chosen</h2><p>Paperback in good condition from private collection.</p><p>Few stories offer more warmth, wisdom, or generosity than this tale of two boys, their fathers, their friendship, and the chaotic times in which they live. Though on the surface it explores religious faith--the intellectually committed as well as the passionately observant--the struggles addressed in <i>The Chosen</i> are familiar to families of all faiths and in all nations. <p> In 1940s Brooklyn, New York, an accident throws Reuven Malther and Danny Saunders together. Despite their differences (Reuven is a Modern Orthodox Jew with an intellectual, Zionist father; Danny is the brilliant son and rightful heir to a Hasidic rebbe), the young men form a deep, if unlikely, friendship. Together they negotiate adolescence, family conflicts, the crisis of faith engendered when Holocaust stories begin to emerge in the U.S., loss, love, and the journey to adulthood. The intellectual and spiritual clashes between fathers, between each son and his own father, and between the two young men, provide a unique backdrop for this exploration of fathers, sons, faith, loyalty, and, ultimately, the power of love. (This is not a conventional children's book, although it will move any wise child age 12 or older, and often appears on summer reading lists for high school students.)</p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Best of Fons &amp; Porter Quilting Quickly</h2><p>Quilting Quickly is the perfect project book for today's quilters who live such busy lives that they can't spend months or years on a quilt.

He signed for Manchester United from Nottingham Forest in 1993. In 2000 he was awarded the PFA Player of the Year 2000. His footballing intelligence and fierce determination helped Ireland to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. But his passion has sometimes given rise to the wrong kind of headlines. His commitment to winning has led to violent confrontation on the pitch and controversy off it.</p><p>Roy Keane was born in Cork in 1971. He signed for Manchester United from Nottingham Forest in 1993. In 2000 he was awarded the PFA Player of the Year 2000. His autobiography will be written with Eamonn Dunphy, bestselling author of Only a Game?From a Cork childhood to the World Cup finals, the story of football&#39;s toughest competitor. Love him or hate him, Roy Keane is the inspiration behind Manchester United FC&#39;s success over the past nine years. A relentless, aggressive midfield general, Keane has epitomized United&#39;s winning approach on the field - at times bringing him into trouble with referees, other managers and, of course, the Football Association. He&#39;s also been in trouble off the pitch as well, and it&#39;s good to see that these incidents have not been omitted. This book is bound to sell in huge quantities in the red half of Manchester, as well as the whole of Dublin, but United&#39;s national - and international - appeal to millions will ensure bumper sales figures for Penguin.</p><h2>The Family Way (A Molly Murphy Mystery)</h2><p>Feeling restless and confined by her pregnancy, Molly is sent to her mother&#39;s for the summer by new husband Daniel, who refuses to let her investigate a disturbing string of baby kidnappings.</p><p><p>RHYS BOWEN is the author of the Anthony and Agatha Award&#x2013;winning Molly Murphy mysteries, the Edgar Award-nominated Evan Evans series, and the Royal Spyness series. Born in England, she lives in San Rafael, California.</p>One<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>New York City, July 1904<br><i>Satan finds work for idle hands to do.</i> That was one of my mother&#x2019;s favorite sayings if she ever caught me daydreaming or lying on my back on the turf, staring up at the white clouds that raced across the sky. I could almost hear her voice, with its strong Irish brogue, as I sat on the sofa and sipped a glass of lemonade on a hot July day.<br>Frankly, I rather wished that Satan would find me something to do with my idle hands because I was dying of boredom. All my life I&#x2019;d been used to hard work, forced to care for my father and three young brothers after my mother went to her heavenly rest. (At least I presume that&#x2019;s where she went. She certainly thought she deserved it.) And now, for the first time in my life, I was a lady of leisure. Ever since I found out I was in the family way, back in February, Daniel had treated me as if I was made of fine porcelain. For the first few months I was glad of his solicitous behavior toward me as I was horribly sick. In fact I began to feel more sympathy for my mother, who had gone through this at least four times. But then, at the start of the fourth month, a miraculous change occurred. I awoke one morning to find that I felt well and hungry and full of energy. Daniel, however, still insisted that I did as little as possible, did not exert myself, took no risks, and generally behave like one of those helpless females I so despised.<br>He wanted me to lie on the couch with my feet up and spend my days making little garments. I had tried to do this and the quality of my sewing and knitting had improved, but still left a lot to be desired. Besides, I knew that my mother-in-law was sewing away diligently and that my neighbors Sid and Gus would shower the child with expensive presents.<br>So this left long hours to be filled every day. Our little house on Patchin Place could be cleaned in a couple of hours. I did a little shopping, but Daniel&#x2019;s job as a police captain meant that he was seldom home for lunch and sometimes not even for dinner, so little cooking was required. I was glad of this when the weather turned hot at the end of June as my growing bulk meant that I felt the heat badly. Daniel suggested that he could fend for himself just fine and I should go up to his mother in Westchester County, where I&#x2019;d be cooler and well looked after. I didn&#x2019;t say it out loud but I&#x2019;d rather have endured a fiery furnace than a prolonged stay with Daniel&#x2019;s mother. Not that she was an ogre or anything, but her standards of perfection and her social interactions with members of high society left me feeling hopelessly inadequate. I knew that she was disappointed that Daniel had not made a better match than an Irish girl with no money and no family connections.<br>She never actually came out and said this, but she made it plain enough. &#x201c;I took tea with the Harpers yesterday,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;I remember that one of the Harper girls was rather sweet on you at one time, Daniel. She&#x2019;s gone on to make an excellent marriage with one of the Van Baarens. Her parents couldn&#x2019;t be happier.&#x201d; And then she&#x2019;d look at me.<br>So I was prepared to endure any amount of heat rather than Daniel&#x2019;s mother. I just wished these last months would hurry up and be over. I put down my lemonade glass and picked up the undershirt I had been attempting to sew. I could see sweaty fingerprints on the fine white cotton and several places where the stitches had been unpicked. I sighed. I just wasn&#x2019;t cut out to be a seamstress. As a detective I hadn&#x2019;t done at all badly, but that profession was now closed to me. Daniel had made me promise that I&#x2019;d give up my agency when we married. I had hoped that Daniel would share his cases with me, that we&#x2019;d sit at the kitchen table and he&#x2019;d ask for my opinion. But he had claimed that his recent cases had been too commonplace to be worth discussing or else so confidential that he had to remain tight-lipped about them.<br>I looked up as the sun suddenly streamed in through the back parlor windows. A sunbeam lit the dust motes in the air and painted a stripe of brightness on the wallpaper. Now this room would soon be too hot for comfort and I&#x2019;d be banished to the front parlor, dark and gloomy, until the sun set. I got up to draw the heavy velvet drapes across the window and noticed that the lace curtains looked rather dingy. That would never do. Having achieved lace curtains for the first time in my life, I should make sure that they remained a pristine white. I went into the kitchen and brought back a high-backed wooden chair. I proceeded to climb on this with some difficulty, then I reached up to unhook the first of the lace curtains.<br>I was at full stretch, standing on tiptoe, when a voice behind me boomed, &#x201c;Molly! What in God&#x2019;s name do you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,&#x201d; I exclaimed. I teetered, and would have fallen if I hadn&#x2019;t grabbed at the velvet drape, which held fast. I looked around to see Daniel standing there with a face like thunder.<br>&#x201c;The curtains needed washing.&#x201d; I glared at him defiantly.<br>&#x201c;You were risking the safety of our baby for the sake of clean curtains?&#x201d; he demanded. He came over and helped me down from the chair. &#x201c;You nearly fell, and what might have happened then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It was only a voice suddenly shouting right behind me that made me lose my balance,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Until you showed up I was doing just fine.&#x201d;<br>He looked at me more tenderly now. &#x201c;Molly, how many times have I told you to take it easy. You&#x2019;re in a delicate condition, my dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nonsense. Women in Ireland have their babies one day and by the end of the week they&#x2019;re out helping their man in the fields again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And how many of those babies die? Your mother didn&#x2019;t live long herself, did she?&#x201d;<br>I chose not to acknowledge the truth in this. Instead I said breezily, &#x201c;Daniel, I feel fine and I&#x2019;m bored to tears doing nothing.&#x201d;<br>He took my arm and led me back to the sofa. &#x201c;Then invite some friends over to tea. I&#x2019;ve introduced you to the wives of some of my colleagues, haven&#x2019;t I? It&#x2019;s about time you built up a circle of social acquaintances. And there are always your friends across the street,&#x201d; he added grudgingly, not being as keen as I on my bohemian neighbors.<br>I sighed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve gone to stay with Gus&#x2019;s relatives in Newport, Rhode Island, to escape the heat,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You remember the mansion with the Roman pillars.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; We&#x2019;d spent our honeymoon in Newport and it had hardly gone as planned. Daniel pulled up the kitchen chair and sat beside me. &#x201c;So why don&#x2019;t you go to my mother as I suggested? You know she&#x2019;d love to make a fuss of you, and feed you well, and it&#x2019;s so much cooler out there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Daniel, I&#x2019;m your wife. My place is taking care of you,&#x201d; I replied, not wanting to tell him the real reason. Isn&#x2019;t it amazing what marriage does to a woman? I was finally learning to be diplomatic. I was one step away from being simpering.<br>&#x201c;I can fend for myself quite well. I&#x2019;ve been doing it for years.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you work long hours, Daniel. It&#x2019;s not right that you should come home to no supper and no clean clothes.&#x201d;<br>He wagged a finger at me. &#x201c;What have I been telling you for months? Then this is the perfect time to get a servant.&#x201d;<br>I sighed. &#x201c;Daniel, let&#x2019;s not go through that again. We really don&#x2019;t need a servant. This is a small house. I&#x2019;m used to hard work. I&#x2019;m happy to cook and clean for you, and for our baby too. If a few more children start to come along, then I may need some help, but for the present....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just the amount of work, Molly. It&#x2019;s the principle of the thing. A man in my position should have a servant. When we start entertaining more, it wouldn&#x2019;t be right that you&#x2019;d have to keep disappearing into the kitchen to see to the dinner. I want you to be the gracious hostess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; I said, my rising temper now winning out over my newfound meekness. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not concern about me at all, is it? You&#x2019;re worried about how you appear in the eyes of society.&#x201d;<br>He looked at my expression and took my hand. &#x201c;Molly, this is not for myself, it&#x2019;s for us. Everything I do from now on is for my family. I want the best for us and for our children. I want to rise in the world, it&#x2019;s true, and I&#x2019;ll be judged on the kind of home I keep and the people I associate with.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;And I want the world to see that I married a beautiful woman.&#x201d;<br>I had to smile at this. &#x201c;You may have been born in America, Daniel Sullivan,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;ve certainly inherited your share of Irish blarney!&#x201d;<br>He smiled too. &#x201c;I am thinking of you, Molly. If you&#x2019;re up all night with a crying baby, you&#x2019;ll appreciate a girl taking over from you so you can get your rest. You say you&#x2019;re bored and have nothing to do&#x2014;well, what better time to train a servant so that she knows your wishes and how this household works by the time the baby arrives?&#x201d;<br>I hesitated, then said, &#x201c;Well, I suppose I could start making inquiries.&#x201d;<br>He jumped to his feet. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I write to my mother and ask for her help in this?&#x201d;<br>Now my hackles truly were rising. &#x201c;Why does your mother have to come into every aspect of our lives?&#x201d; I demanded. &#x201c;Do you not believe I&#x2019;m capable of finding a servant for myself?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course you are. I&#x2019;m simply trying to spare you extra toil and bother. I don&#x2019;t want you traipsing around the city at this time of year.

This great, sprawling rangeland was broken by lonely buttes and wandering ravines. It was a huge, almost empty, always challenging land. Its vastness made the small man smaller and the big man king.<br>Where once the shaggy-maned buffalo had grazed, a herd of six hundred red-coated Hereford cattle was gathered in a pocket of the plains. Held in place by an encircling group of riders, they bawled their discontent. Into this milling confusion, cowboys working in pairs walked their horses into the herd to slowly and methodically cut out the crippled cattle -- dry cows, the cows with poor spring calves, and the odd steer that had escaped the previous autumn's roundup.<br>Webb Calder pointed the nose of his claybank stud at the cow to be separated from the herd, then sat deep and easy in the saddle to let the horse do its work. The stallion was the color of the yellow mountain cat from which it took its name, Cougar. The instant the cow was isolated, the claybank frustrated its every attempt to rejoin the herd -- getting low, coming around on a dime, and springing forward with the swiftness of a cat.<br>To the big-boned man in the saddle, the rangy stallion was a source of pride. He'd picked the horse out of a range-wild group of yearlings and earmarked it for his personal remuda. The breaking and training he'd done himself, turning the animal into the best cow horse on the spread. It was never something Webb Calder bragged about, and any compliment was met with the casually indifferent reply, "The claybank is good."<br>He had a philosophy that if you were the best, you didn't have to tell anybody -- and if you weren't, then you'd damned well better keep your mouth shut. He lived by it, and expected the others around him to live by it, too.<br>When he and the yellow horse had the cow separated from the herd, the cowboys moved in from the flanks to push the animal over the lip of the ground's pocket to where the cut of injured or inferior cattle were being held. Two more riders took his place to work the herd.<br>Riding back to the gather, Webb was joined by Nate Moore, who had worked the cut with him. The lank, weather-beaten rider was one of a small corps of cowboys who had their roots dug as deep into this Montana range as Webb Calder had. Yet, some invisible quality stamped Webb Calder as the cattle owner.<br>For this was Calder land as far to the south as the eye could see, and beyond. All the livestock, except strays from the bordering small ranches to the north, carried the Triple C brand of the Calder Cattle Company. It was the heritage left by the first Calder who pulled up stakes in Texas and drove his herd north in 1878 to find free grass. That ancestor, Chase Benteen Calder, had carved out an empire that was measured in square miles numbering nearly six hundred. He'd held it against warring bands of renegade Indians, homesteaders, and jealously ambitious neighboring ranchers. He'd paid for it with Calder blood, nourished it with his sweat and the bones of drought-stricken cattle, and buried the Calder dead under the Montana grass.<br>Of the score of cowboys who had made the drive with Chase Benteen Calder, most had drifted, but a few had stayed to build a new life in this raw land. These men formed the nucleus of the group of forerunners to Nate Moore, Virg Haskell's wife, Ruth, Slim Trumbo, Ike Willis, and a handful of others, born and raised on the Calder ranch, like Webb. Their loyalty was a deep-seeded thing, ingrained into their souls as surely as if they carried the Triple C brand.<br>This thread of continuity ran through each generation, tying them together. The old ones eventually gave way to young blood, bringing change without ever changing.<br>Cresting the rise of the untamed plain, Webb reined in his horse. Satisfaction ran easy through him as he surveyed the scene before him, the teamwork of all the riders working the herd with efficient, well-oiled precision. He liked it best when he could get out among them. Although he was there out of necessity, since his decision determined which was the poorer stock to be culled from this herd, the sheer pleasure of the work made him take part in the actual cutting of the cattle.<br>The pressures and responsibilities were enormous and endless for the man who owned a ranch as vast as this. New salesmen or cattle buyers often commented on its size, and Webb was fond of quipping dryly, "It takes a big chunk of ground to fit under a Calder sky." He didn't know how it ranked against other big ranches in the country, whether it was first, second, third, or far down on the list. If anyone asked him, he couldn't have answered and he didn't care enough to check. His only interests lay in making it prosper and keeping it intact for his son.<br>The responsibilities were heavy, but so was the power he wielded. Webb Calder believed himself to be a fair man. There were some who would say he was exacting. And still others would claim that he ruled with an iron hand. Resentment born out of envy and jealousy made him the object of hatred from a silent few. As far as Webb Calder was concerned, he had never raised his hand against a man without cause. When he acted, it was swift and with purpose. Indecision could eventually spell disaster for an outfit the size of the Triple C.<br>It was one of the things he'd tried to teach his son, Chase Calder, named after their Texan ancestor. There was more to running a ranch than keeping books, raising cattle, and going to the bank. But how do you teach a man to be a leader, to handle men?<br>Before Chase had taken his first step, Webb had set the baby boy on a saddle atop an old bellmare and wrapped the tiny fists around the saddle horn to take him on his first ride. By the time Chase was two, he was given the reins. When he was five, he went on his first roundup, tied to the saddle so he wouldn't fall off if he fell asleep.<br>Horses and cattle were part of living. Those things Chase learned by osmosis, unconsciously absorbing the knowledge into his system until it was second nature.<br>But it was the subtleties of command that Webb wanted him to learn. From the time the boy had understood his first sentence, Webb had tried to drum these things into his head, shaping and molding Chase to take over the ranch someday. He'd warned Chase that as his son, he would have to work longer, be smarter, and fight rougher than any man-jack out there. No favor would ever be granted him by Webb -- no concession would ever be made because Chase was a Calder. There would be no special privileges because he was the rancher's son. In fact, the reverse would be true. In his teens, Chase had the hardest jobs, the rankest horses, and the longest hours of any man on the place. Any problems were his to solve. If there was trouble, he had to be man enough to fight his way out of it, either with his fists or his wits. Chase couldn't come to his father and expect help. Webb pushed him as hard as he dared without breaking the boy's spirit.<br>Even as Webb Calder watched the two dozen horsemen at work, he unconsciously and instinctively kept an eye on his son. Chase was taller than the average cowboy, wide in the shoulders and solid in the chest, yet youthfully lean and supple with a rider's looseness about him. The sun had burned a layer of tan over hard and angular Calder features. Dark-haired and dark-eyed, he seemed older than twenty-two -- except when he smiled. Then he seemed careless and guileless. His son was still an unknown quantity to Webb. Maybe some might think he demanded too much, but he was firmly convinced it was the tough things that were good for a man.<br>The horse beside the claybank blew out a relaxed snort, making Webb shift his glance to Nate Moore. He was building a smoke and licked the paper with a stingy tongue. Without looking up, he spoke. "He's a good boy." He guessed the object of Webb's thoughts.<br>"Lil would be proud of him." Webb uttered his late wife's name and broke a silence that had lasted more than twenty years since her death. Time had erased the grief of his loss. Now the memory of her was another tradition.<br>It was something an outsider couldn't understand -- this lack of expression the true Western man showed when he lost a comrade or a loved one -- the failure to reveal keen sorrow. What a man felt was kept inside. The face an outsider saw looked cold and unemotional. Yet beneath the hard exteriors of these men, there was all the delicate sensitivity of a woman, hidden from view. Revealing it displayed weakness. This was a land where only the strong survived.<br>"Yes, she would," Nate spoke with the cigarette in his mouth and squinted his eyes at the pungent smoke curling from it. The expression deepened the sun-creased lines splaying from the corners of his eyes. Without turning his head, his attention shifted to the young cowboy, Buck Haskell, riding on the same side of the herd where Chase was. For apparently no reason, Buck had spun his sorrel horse to face the opposite direction and spurred it toward a slight gap between riders, reaching an invisible point the instant a cow attempted to break from the herd. Respect glinted in the older cowhand's eyes. "That Buckie has more cow sense than some cowboys three times his age," Nate declared. "And how he loves those rank broncs. The more contrary they are, the better he likes 'em."<br>Webb's mouth tightened. "Yeah, and he's always got his rope down. I've never caught him at it, but I know he does."<br>"Hell!" Nate chuckled. "Every young cowboy is going to sneak off and rope something now and then."<br>Webb conceded that with a lift of his heavy brows. "Buck is a likable boy, but I worry about that wild streak in him."<br>With curly blond hair, blue eyes, and a perpetual grin, Buck was Virg and Ruth Haskell's son, born two days before Chase. When Webb's wife, Lillian, didn't have enough milk to breast-feed Chase, Ruth had taken over as wetnurse. A year and a half later, after Lil had died, Ruth cooked and kept house for Webb. So Buck and Chase had been raised practically as brothers. It was natural that Webb took extra interest in Buck.<br>The hand-rolled cigarette never left Nate's mouth, but he managed to pull the corners into a dry smile. "You're forgettin', Webb. We were wilder than that when we were twenty-two."<br>He exchanged a wry glance with the cowboy. "Maybe so."<br>From the broken land to the north, a trio of riders approached the herd's gathering point. Webb centered his gaze on the short, wiry rider a half-stride in the lead. His face lost its expression, becoming heavyboned and hard.<br>"Who's that with O'Rourke?" He didn't take his eyes from the owner of the small, two-bit spread on a north strip of the Calder boundary.<br>Nate looked, his eyes narrowing less from the smoke and more from recognition. "His boy. The skinny one must be his girl." He had pulled the warmth from his voice, making it flat.<br>As he skimmed the pair riding with Angus O'Rourke, Webb inspected first the gangling eighteen-year-old boy with lank black hair sticking out from beneath his hat. The boy kept looking at his father, seeking some form of guidance. The girl was a small slip of a thing, looking more like a young boy than a girl. There was a glimpse of the slick, black sides of her hair beneath the hat, but Webb couldn't tell whether it was cut that short or pushed under the crown. Both the shirt and the Levi's appeared to be cast-offs of her brother's. Both were too large, making her look all the more skinny and shapeless. Except for the heavy fringe of lashes around her green eyes, there was nothing about the set of her features to distinguish her from an immature boy. There were spurs on the heels of her rundown boots, an old and cracked pair of leather gloves on her hands, and an ill-fitting jacket dwarfing her small frame. The sight of her rankled Webb.<br>"A girl shouldn't be doing a man's work," he muttered and turned his head to thrust his hard gaze at Nate. "You ride down there and tell the men to watch their language. If I hear so much as a 'goddamn' out of them with that girl around, there's going to be hell to pay when she leaves."<br>Nate pinched the fire off the end of his cigarette, letting the ember fall into the cuff of his denims, where it was crushed dead. The unsmoked portion of the cigarette was tucked away in his pocket as he reined his mount toward the cowboys working the herd.<br>Webb watched him leave. The modern world may have advanced into the space age with computers and high technology, but there were sections of the West where time had changed very little. Everything was more mechanized, but most of the work was still done on horseback.<br>The old codes lingered. Women were scarce and treated with respect until they showed they didn't deserve it. A man settled his own problems; he didn't take them to someone else. It wasn't hard to understand when put in perspective. In the case of the Triple C, there was a thirty-five-mile-long driveway before you reached the front porch of the main house. A respectable-sized town of more than a population of one hundred could be a hundred miles away, and more.<br>The Calder ranch sat on an area of land larger than the state of Rhode Island. With the kind of power that gave Webb Calder, he was virtually his own law, answerable to almost no one but God Almighty. Wisely, he never tried to ride roughshod over anyone else, only now and then letting his authority be felt. He turned a blind eye to the dirt-farming Andersen family trying to eke out a living on a half-section of ground on his east boundary. Webb knew they butchered a steer or two of his each year, but he wouldn't see women and children go hungry. But God help the man who lifted his hand against the Triple C for his own gain.<br>His gaze narrowed in silent speculation on Angus O'Rourke, who was riding toward him. The man spent too much time dreaming and found too many excuses for why he couldn't succeed. O'Rourke was a weak man, always wanting the easy way. There wasn't any place for that kind in this country. Sooner or later they were weeded out.<br>The hard, fixed stare from Calder made Angus uncomfortable. How he'd love to ride up and spit in the man's eye. He licked his dry lips nervously, telling himself that the day would come when he wouldn't have to kowtow to the likes of Webb Calder. But the assurance was old and rang hollow in his mind. He'd been a dark, handsome man once, with glib Irish charm, but lines of dissipation were beginning to take away his looks, and people no longer believed in his grandiose plans for the future, having heard too many in the past that came to naught.<br>"If he asks us anything, what should we say?" The anxiously whispered question came from his son.<br>Angus didn't turn his head or look around to answer. "Don't say anything. I'll do the talking."<br>"I told you we should have hazed those thirty head back across the fence last week, Pa," the girl stated calmly.<br>"And I told you they needed a few more days of good grass, Maggie!" The argument had already been hashed over several times. "Those cows just strayed, that's all. And we're just here to cut out our strays, like we always do."<br>He reined his horse down to a walk to cross the last few yards to Webb Calder, stopping at a right angle to him. Flashing the man one of his patented smiles, he respectfully touched a finger to the pointed brim of his Stetson.<br>"Good morning, Mr. Calder." Angus O'Rourke sounded deliberately cheerful and carefree.<br>"Angus." The stone-faced man with the hard eyes simply nodded in response to the greeting.<br>Irritation rippled through Angus. He was angry with himself for not calling Calder by his first name, and putting them on equal terms. The man had a way of making him feel worthless...</p><h2>X-Men: Gals on the Run</h2><p>International superstar Milo Manara joins X-Legend Chris Claremont for X-Women!

The bubbling clockwork song died out with a series of clicks and sad groans; it hadn&#x2019;t been working well to begin with. <br>Twenty kilometers away, the central peak of Djamonkin Crater rose through blue-gray haze, its tip outlined in ruddy gold by the last of the setting sun. A single brilliant moon rose bright and cold behind our boat. The crater&#x2019;s inland lake rippled around the hull in ways no tide or wind had ever moved water. Under the swells and whorls, sparkling with reflected sunset and moon, pale merse twisted and bobbed like the lilies in my mother&#x2019;s pond. These lilies, however, weren&#x2019;t passive flowers, but sleeping krakens growing in the shallows on thick stalks. Ten meters wide, their thickened, muscular edges were rimmed with black teeth the length of my forearm. <br>We sailed over a garden of clannish, self-cloning monsters. They covered the entire flooded floor of the crater, skulking just below the surface and very defensive of their territory. Only boats that sang the lulling song the merse used to keep peace among themselves could cross these waters unmolested. And now it seemed our tunes were out of date. <br>The young human I knew as Chakas crossed the deck, clutching his palm-frond hat and shaking his head. We stood side by side and stared out over the rail, watching the merse writhe and churn. Chakas&#x2014;bronze-skinned, practically hairless, and totally unlike the bestial image of humans my tutors had impressed upon me&#x2014;shook his head in dismay. &#x201c;They swear they&#x2019;re using the newest songs,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t move until they figure it out.&#x201d; <br>I eyed the crew on the bow, engaged in whispered argument. &#x201c;You assured me they were the best,&#x201d; I reminded him. <br>He regarded me with eyes like polished onyx and swept his hand through a thick thatch of black hair that hung in back to his neck, cut perfectly square. &#x201c;My father knew their fathers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You trust your father?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen my real father in three years,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Is that sad, for you?&#x201d; the young human asked. <br>&#x201c;He sent me <i>there</i>.&#x201d; I pointed to a bright russet point in the black sky. &#x201c;To learn discipline.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shh- <i>shhaa</i>!&#x201d; The Florian&#x2014;a smaller variety of human, half Chakas&#x2019;s height&#x2014;scampered from the stern on bare feet to join us. I had never known a species to vary so widely yet maintain such an even level of intelligence. His voice was soft and sweet, and he made delicate signs with his fingers. In his excitement, he spoke too rapidly for me to understand. <br>Chakas interpreted. &#x201c;He says you need to take off your armor. It&#x2019;s upsetting the merse.&#x201d; <br>At first, this was not a welcome suggestion. Forerunners of all rates wear body-assist armor through much of their lives. The armor protects us both physically and medically. In emergencies, it can suspend a Forerunner until rescue, and even provide nourishment for a time. It allows mature Forerunners to connect to the Domain, from which all Forerunner knowledge can flow. Armor is one of the main reasons that Forerunners live so long. It can also act as friend and advisor. <br>I consulted with my ancilla, the armor&#x2019;s disembodied intelligence and memory&#x2014;a small bluish figure in the back of my thoughts. <br>&#x201c;This was anticipated,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Electrical and magnetic fields, other than those generated by the planet&#x2019;s natural dynamics, drive these organisms into splashing fury. That is why the boat is powered by a primitive steam engine.&#x201d; <br>She assured me that the armor would be of no value to humans, and that at any rate she could guard against its misuse. The rest of the crew watched with interest. I sensed this might be a sore point. The armor would power down, of course, once I removed it. For all our sakes, I would have to go naked, or nearly so. I halfway managed to convince myself this could only enhance the adventure. <br>The Florian set to work weaving me a pair of sandals from reeds used to plug leaks. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Of all my father&#x2019;s children, I was the most incorrigible. In itself this was not an ill mark or even unusual. Manipulars of promise often show early rebellion&#x2014;the stamp in raw metal from which the discipline of a full rate is honed and shaped. <br>But I exceeded even my father&#x2019;s ample patience; I refused to learn and advance along any of the proper Forerunner curves: intensive training, bestowal to my rate, mutation to my next form, and finally, espousal to a nascent triad&nbsp;&#x2026; where I would climb to the zenith of maturity. <br>None of that attracted me. I was more far interested in adventure and the treasures of the past. Historic glory shined so much brighter in my eyes; the present seemed empty. <br>And so at the end of my sixth year, frustrated beyond endurance by my stubbornness, my father traded me to another family, in another part of the galaxy, far from the Orion complex where my peoples were born. <br>For the last three years, the system of eight planets around a minor yellow star&#x2014;and in particular, the fourth, a dry, reddish desert world called Edom&#x2014;became my home. Call it exile. I called it escape. I knew my destiny lay elsewhere. <br>When I arrived on Edom, my swap-father, following tradition, equipped my armor with one of his own ancillas to educate me to the ways of my new family. At first I thought this new ancilla would be the most obvious face of my indoctrination&#x2014;just another shackle in my prison, harsh and unsympathetic. But she soon proved something else entirely, unlike any ancilla I had ever experienced. <br>During my long periods of tutoring and regimented exercise, she drew me out, traced my rough rebellion back to its roots&#x2014;but also showed me my new world and new family in the clear light of unbiased reason. <br>&#x201c;You are a Builder sent to live among Miners,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Miners are rated below Builders, but they are sensible, proud and strong. Miners know the raw, inner ways of worlds. Respect them, and they will treat you well, teach you what they know, and return you to your family with all the discipline and skills a Manipular needs to advance.&#x201d; <br>After two years of generally impeccable service, guiding my reeducation while at the same time relieving my stultifying existence with a certain dry wit, she came to discern a pattern in my questions. Her response was unexpected. <br>The first sign of my ancilla&#x2019;s strange favor was her opening of my swap-family&#x2019;s archives. Ancillas are charged with the maintenance of all records and libraries, to ease access to any information a member of the family might need, however ancient and obscure. &#x201c;Miners, you know, delve deep. Treasure, as you call it, is frequently in their way. They recover, record, settle the matter with the proper authorities&nbsp;&#x2026; and move on. They are not curious, but their records are sometimes <i>very</i> curious.&#x201d; <br>I spent happy hours studying the old records, and learned much more about Precursor remnants, as well as the archaeology of Forerunner history. <br>Here it was that I picked up hints of lore discouraged or forgotten elsewhere&#x2014;not always in actual evidence, but deduced from this and that odd fact. <br>And in that next year, my ancilla measured and judged me. <br>One dry and dusty day, as I climbed the gentle slope of Edom&#x2019;s largest volcano, imagining that in the vast caldera was hidden some great secret that would redeem me in the eyes of my family and justify my existence&#x2014;my common state of pointless fugue&#x2014;she broke ancilla code in a shocking manner. <br>She confessed that she had once, a thousand years ago, been part of the retinue of the Librarian. Of course, I knew about the greatest Lifeworker of all. I wasn&#x2019;t completely ignorant. Lifeworkers&#x2014;experts on living things and medicine&#x2014;rank below both Builders and Miners, but just above Warriors. And the highest rank of Lifeworker is Lifeshaper. The Librarian was one of just three Lifeworkers ever honored with that rank. <br>The ancilla&#x2019;s memory of her time with the Librarian had supposedly been expunged when the Librarian&#x2019;s foundation traded her to my swap-family, as part of a general cultural exchange; but now, fully reawakened to her past, it seemed she was prepared to conspire with me. <br>She told me: &#x201c;There is a world just a few hours&#x2019; journey from Edom where you might find what you seek. Nine thousand years ago, the Librarian established a research station in this system. It is still a topic of discussion among the Miners, who of course disapprove. Life is ever so much more slippery than rocks and gases.&#x201d; <br>This station was located on the system&#x2019;s third planet, known as Erde-Tyrene: a forsaken place, obscure, sequestered, and both the origin and final repository of the last of a degraded species called <i>human.</i> <br>My ancilla&#x2019;s motives, it seemed, were even more deviant than my own. Every few months, a craft lifted away from Edom to carry supplies downstar to Erde-Tyrene. She did not precisely inform me of what I would find there, but through hints and clues led me to decide it was major. <br>With her help, I made my way through the labyrinthine hallways and tunnels to the shipping platform, smuggled myself onto the cramped craft, reset the codes to conceal my extra mass&#x2014;and lifted away to Erde-Tyrene. <br>I was now much more than just a rebellious Manipular. I had become a hijacker, a pirate&nbsp;&#x2026; And was astonished at how easy it was! Too easy, perhaps. <br>Still, I could not believe an ancilla would lead a Forerunner into a trap.

Recognized figures such as Anni Albers&#x2014;the first textile artist to be exhibited at the MoMA&#x2014;and Marianne Brandt&#x2014;whose elegant geometric tableware have become classic Alessi designs&#x2014;are showcased alongside previously unknown artists such as Gertrud Grunow, who taught "Harmonizing Science"; Helene B�rner, who led the textile workshop; and Ilse Fehling, a sculptor and the most sought-after set and costume designer of her generation. Founded in 1919, the Bauhaus and most of its students were poor and lacking in just about everything. What it did have, however, was an abundance of enthusiasm, talent, and innovative creativity. Furthermore, over half of those seeking to enroll at the school were women. This tornado of the "fairer sex" was initially seen as a threat, and the weaving mill was quickly turned into a separate "women&#x2019;s facility." Nevertheless, over the years the mill became a hotbed of groundbreaking production, whose impact far surpassed national borders, as demonstrated by the international acclaim of photographers Lucia Moholy, Florence Henri, and Grete Stern.</p><p>Ulrike M�ller studied ecclesiastical music, philosophy, theology, and literary sciences in Hamburg.

That her amazing personality would attract me, just as it had seduced thousands of others, was a foregone conclusion. Her helter-skelter charm was, after all, notorious ...'</p><p>When shy young heir Patrick is orphaned at the tender age of ten, the only family he has is his wealthy and eccentric aunt, a fabulous New York socialite named Mame. While prone to dramatic costumes, flights of fancy and expensive whims - not least her lives as a muse and a Southern belle - Auntie Mame will raise Patrick the only way she knows how: with madcap humour, mishaps, unforgettable friends and lots and lots of love. Turned into a play, a musical, and adapted into a 1974 film directed by Gene Saks and starring Lucille Ball, <i>Auntie Mame</i> is the most magnificent and hilarious work of love, style, wit and the life of a very modern Aunt. </p><p>Patrick Dennis (1921-76) was one of the most widely read American authors of the 1950s and '60s. Among his sixteen novels, the majority of which were bestsellers, are <i>Little Me</i>, <i>Around the World with</i> <i>Auntie Mame</i>, <i>Tony</i>, <i>How Firm a Foundation</i> and <i>Genius</i>. A celebrity in bohemian New York culture, he led a double life as a bisexual man and a conventional husband and father, until becoming an exemplary butler to the elite in West Palm Beach and Chicago in the 1970s. In his own words, he attributed this change to being 'out of fashion' - and, 'I've said everything that I had to say.

Mame first burst upon the public's consciousness in 1955, with the publication of Patrick Dennis's classic novel, <i>Auntie Mame</i>. More than 40 years later, the book is still in print, and still a delight to read. <p> Who can resist that force of nature, Mame Dennis, who takes over the rearing of her orphaned nephew Patrick and turns his life into one wild escapade after another? She enrolls Patrick in a progressive school where, among other things, the students strip naked and pretend to be fish, laying and fertilizing eggs; in a later chapter, she busts him out of a conservative prep school, driving a stolen car. During Patrick's college years, she's almost caught dallying with one of his classmates in the dorm. </p><p> Auntie Mame is a novel that holds up well over the years. The times it describes were simpler in many ways than they are today, which may account for some of the book's charm. But in the end, the success of Patrick Dennis's frequently hilarious and always entertaining tribute to unconventional family life rests on the affectionate, funny friendship between young Patrick and his one-of-a-kind guardian.</p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Harvest</h2><p>A girl and her mother spend the day gathering vegetables, fruit, and herbs from their garden.</p><p>Kris Waldherr writes, illustrates, and designs books for children and adults, including Persephone and the Pomegranate, The Wolfhound, The Book of Goddesses, and Sacred Animals. She studied art on a full scholarship to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Ms. Waldherr lives with her husband in Brooklyn, New York.reS-Gr 2-This beautiful, earthy book is a child's hymn to harvest time. A young girl celebrates it all in one day, and thinks back on the efforts of both the gardeners and the plants. She picks, digs, and gathers fruit, vegetables, herbs, and flowers with great care and appreciation; then she and her mother bake, store, and can, getting ready for winter. The watercolor-and-gouache paintings, mostly double-page spreads, are rich in autumn colors. Each picture is framed by a border that echoes some of the plants within; these appear as if behind a scrim, reminding readers that the colors will fade and the plants will die down as the circle of seasons continues. The last painting shows the narrator asleep in her cozy bed as snowflakes fall outside; her cat, who has appeared in nearly every picture as a quiet helper, is also asleep. A bouquet of dried flowers and a pail of small pumpkins decorate the room. Under the scene is the last bit of text: "We have harvested our garden. All year we have worked so hard. All year our garden has worked so hard.

Her first, Music From a Place Called Half Moon. was awarded the Bank Street College Children&#39;s Book Award. She lives with her husband in Lexington, Kentucky.Kindergarten-Grade 3-- At the end of the first day, First Woman tries to convince First Man that ``The people need to know the laws.'' Impatiently, he tells her to write them in the sky. She takes a blanket full of her jewels (stars) and with infinite patience begins ``designing her pattern so all could read it.'' Coyote asks to help, but when he sees the magnitude of the task he grumbles, then flings the remaining stars into the night sky, forever obscuring the pattern. As the second day dawns, the people go about their lives, ``. . . never knowing the reason for the confusion that would always dwell among them.'' This Navajo tale acknowledges the common human feeling that there IS a message in the stars--the laws of a clear and orderly universe--if it could be read. It absolves humans of guilt (Coyote did it) and provides a First Woman who is a strong, positive, and beneficent figure. The concise and graceful text is matched with illustrations in a primitive but dramatic vein, marked by simplified shapes, saturated matte colors, and desert-stark composition. The claret-sandstone earth and deep lapis sky, meeting at a curved horizon, dominate most pages; the white of eyes and starlight punctuate the design. This handsome book might well fit into a myth or Native American collection, but it can stand on its own timely and attractive merits as well.<br><i>- Patricia Dooley, Univ. of Washington Extension, Seattle</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Traitor&#39;s Ruin (Traitor&#39;s Trilogy, 2)</h2><p><p>In Erin Beaty's <i>The Traitor's Ruin</i>, war breaks out between nations and Sage Fowler must infiltrate enemy territory to reconnect with her first love, Captain Alex Quinn. </p><p>A captain with a secret.<br>A spy with a mission.<br>A kingdom on the verge of ruin.</p><p>After proving her worth as a deft spy and strategic matchmaker, Sage Fowler is now comfortably positioned in high society as the royal tutor.

His ground-breaking The Way Things Work has become a modern classic. He won the Caldecott Medal for Black and White. He lives in Vermont.</p>*Starred Review* Let&#x2019;s face it. Macaulay wrote the book on castles: his Caldecott Honor winner Castle (1977), later reenvisioned as part of Built to Last (2010). Now he revisits the topic with a younger audience and a new purpose in mind, recalling in an introductory note that as a kid, he didn&#x2019;t like reading, but he found that pictures made it more fun. Actually, with lines like &#x201c;Archers will greet you with flaming arrows,&#x201d; the text here is fun, too. As the narrative begins, a castle stands on a hill, while would-be attackers skulk on another hill in the foreground. Short sentences offer plenty of intriguing information about the castle, its inhabitants, and their many means of defense. Readers are occasionally addressed informally, &#x201c;Are you friend or foe?&#x201d; Pretty soon, the attackers make their move. Despite their alarming weapons (battering rams, catapults), it&#x2019;s clear that in the end, the defenders will prevail. The format is slightly larger than a typical book for beginning readers, giving a bit more scope for the illustrations: strong line drawings with color washes. The use of different perspectives and cross sections is particularly fine. A promising start for Macaulay&#x2019;s new My Readers series of nonfiction.

Following their deaths, she set up the Gallmann Memorial Foundation to promote new ways of combining development and conservation, and to provide sponsorship for the education of Kenyans. I Dreamed of Africa was first published in 1991 to international acclaim and it became a world-wide bestseller. Her subsequent books, African Nights and Night of the Lions, were also published by Penguin. She lives in Kenya with her daughter and her dogs.Both a dream fulfilled and personal tragedy are revealed in this moving memoir. As a child living in Italy, the author was fascinated with Africa.

It is unsentimental, rigorous and utterly original. Camping in the garden, riding bikes through the woods, climbing trees, collecting bugs, picking wildflowers, running through piles of autumn leaves...These are the things childhood memories are made of. But for a whole generation of today&#39;s children the pleasures of a free-range childhood are missing, and their indoor habits contribute to epidemic obesity, attention-deficit disorder, isolation and childhood depression. &#34;Last Child in the Woods&#34; is a clarion call, brilliantly written, compelling and irresistibly persuasive - a book that will change minds and lives.</p><p>&#x201c;I like to play indoors better &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s where all the electrical outlets are,&#x201d; reports a fourth grader. But it&#x2019;s not only computers, television, and video games that are keeping kids inside. It&#x2019;s also their parents&#x2019; fears of traffic, strangers, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus; their schools&#x2019; emphasis on more and more homework; their structured schedules; and their lack of access to natural areas. Local governments, neighborhood associations, and even organizations devoted to the outdoors are placing legal and regulatory constraints on many wild spaces, sometimes making natural play a crime. <br> <br>As children&#x2019;s connections to nature diminish and the social, psychological, and spiritual implications become apparent, new research shows that nature can offer powerful therapy for such maladies as depression, obesity, and attentiondeficit disorder. Environment-based education dramatically improves standardized test scores and grade-point averages and develops skills in problem solving, critical thinking, and decision making. Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that childhood experiences in nature stimulate creativity. <br> <br>In Last Child in the Woods, Louv talks with parents, children, teachers, scientists, religious leaders, child-development researchers, and environmentalists who recognize the threat and offer solutions. Louv shows us an alternative future, one in which parents help their kids experience the natural world more deeply&#x2014;and find the joy of family connectedness in the process.In his groundbreaking work about the staggering divide between children and the outdoors, journalist and child advocate Richard Louv directly links the absence of nature in the lives of today&#39;s wired generatoin to some of the most disturbing childhood trends: the rise in obesity, attention disorders, and depression. This is the first book to bring together a body of research indicating that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy childhood development and for the physical and emotional helath of children and adults. More than just raising an alarm, Louv offers practical solutions to heal the broken bond.</p><h2>Real Lace Revisited: Inside the Hidden World of America&#x2019;s Irish Aristocracy</h2><p>Here is a revisitation--part tribute, part update--of Stephen Birmingham's much-loved Real Lace. James P. MacGuire, a member of one of Birmingham's Irish Families, creates his own entertaining portrait of life among the Irish Rich, further detailing and filling out this engrossing portion of America's social history.<br> <br>Real Lace Revisited chronicles the religious, financial and social evolution of the First Irish Families&#x2019; world, its rise, peak, decline, fall, and, in some cases, transformative rebirth. Rather than a memoir, however, the book reads as an informed historical, non-fiction account of the upper-class Irish world as it grew and changed. Real Lace Revisited is always accessible and highly readable, enlivened by MacGuire&#x2019;s gift for storytelling, encyclopedic knowledge, and often humorous insight into the families concerned.</p><p>James P. MacGuire was born in New York and educated at Johns Hopkins and Cambridge. He has worked, inter alia, at Time Inc., Macmillan, The Health Network, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. His poetry, fiction and journalism have been published in many national publications. <br>He is the author or co-author of ten books and two beloved sons, Pierce and Rhoads.In Real Lace Revisited James MacGuire does for American Irish Catholics what Evelyn Waugh did for those eccentric English recusants at Brideshead: with wit, insight, and critically engaging affection he brings several generations to a life beyond life. But this account, soaring from Birmingham's springboard, has the added authority of a true insider who grew up with the very families he chronicles--from the McDonnells and Murrays to the Kennedys and Buckleys. His personal appraisal rings as pitch-perfect as a Louis Auchincloss novel of WASP society. Birmingham must be beaming from Paradise as he shines here by reflected glory. As Scott Fitzgerald best put it: 'If it wasn't life, it was magnificent'. (Charles Scribner)<br><br>For those of a certain age and ancestry, Real Lace Revisited, though thoroughly enjoyable, cannot help but prove wistful. In his refreshing way, Jamie MacGuire paints a beautiful portrait of a beautiful era, now faded, of important and colorful characters (some with, some without, brogues) who proved central to the formation of a great nation. In particular, in a time when religious freedom has been shaken by ideology, his Foreword profiling the Carrolls of Maryland is a welcome history lesson that should be read proudly by all Americans, whether "Irish" or not.

In the 1930s, he produced some of the most visually arresting and politically hard-hitting artwork of the 20th century, appropriating the widely circulated propaganda of the time to create its total antithesis. In his own words, he used &#x201c;laughter as a devastating weapon&#x201d; to target the Nazis, which made him a target for Nazi censorship. In 1933, the Gestapo destroyed much of his work, after which he produced his brilliantly terrifying images in exile.

Gino hates his job of sweeping the factory floor after school each day, preferring to sculpt mice and other creatures from chunks of dough swept up from the floor, which he leaves everywhere. When he overhears his worried family discussing the failing business, he takes matters in his own hands, and, in the aftermath of his attempt to help, his macaroni mice are shipped to stores. His future is insured. The Badino family--human bodies, expressive mice heads--is portrayed in subdued watercolor and ink in a factory OSHA would shut down in a minute (although the workers do wear gloves). A good example of extended family solidarity is presented in the business, along with a concern for a quality product. Lightly amusing, but not a first purchase. --Virginia Opocensky, formerly at Lincoln City Libraries, NB<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Badino Pasta is in trouble. Bigger companies are producing more pasta more quickly, and selling it more cheaply. Every Badino must lend a hand (or paw--the Badinos are mice), and young Gino's job is to sweep the factory at the end of the day. But alas, Gino has an artist's soul: instead of sweeping, he spends his time molding animals from bits of leftover pasta dough. And though Gino's creations win praise from his teachers and friends, they cause conflict at home. But when some of the little creatures accidentally wind up in store-bound boxes, they prove a hit. The author/illustrator of the Josephina books and The Little Lump of Clay presents a delightful extended family (in which "my little linguine" is a term of endearment), and cooks up an easy-to-swallow message about the good things that can come from following your heart.

On the day of the vote in Parliament, while the session was being filmed by TV cameras, a band of right-wing soldiers burst in with automatic weapons, ordering everyone to get down. Only three men defied the order. For thirty-five minutes, as the cameras rolled, they stayed in their seats.</p><p>Critically adored novelist Javier Cercas originally set out to write a novel about this pivotal moment, but determined it had already gained an air of myth, or, through the annual broadcast of video clips, had at least acquired the fictional taint of reality television. Cercas turned to nonfiction, and his vivid descriptions of the archival footage frame a narrative that traverses the line between history and art, creating a daring new account of this watershed moment in modern Spanish history.</p><p><i>The Anatomy of a Moment</i> caused a sensation upon its publication in Spain, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. The story will be new to many American readers, but the book stands resolutely on its own as a compelling literary inquest of national myth, personal memory, political spectacle, and reality itself.</p></p><p><p><b>Javier Cercas</b> is the author of <i>Soldiers of Salamis, The Tenant &amp; The Motive </i>and <i>The Speed of Light</i>.

Cercas writes that he originally tried to fictionalize the event and turn it into 'a strange experimental <i>The Three Musketeers</i>'; that's exactly how the book turned out, and didn't have to fictionalize a thing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;When the historical going gets tough, as it invariably does here, Cercas the novelist gently leaves all the facts where Cercas the essayist found them, and creates by their side a kind of simulacrum of the moment--more supple and analytically pliable, capable of showing us more even if what we're looking at is ever so slightly different from the original...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Nation</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] tour de force...

On Gor, there are three different kinds of beings that are labeled beasts: there are the Kurii, a monster alien race that is preparing to invade Gor from space; the Gorean warriors, who fight with viciousness almost primitive in its blood lust&#39; and then there are the slave girls of Gor, lowly beasts for men to do with as they see fit, be it as objects of labor or desire. Now all three come together as the Kurii fight to take over Gor with its first beachhead on the planet&#39;s polar ice cap. As all three kinds of beasts struggle together, an incredible adventure is told, one that begins in lands of burning heat and ends up in the bitter cold of the polar north among the savage red hunters of the polar ice pack. Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the first book of the Gorean Saga, TARNSMAN OF GOR, E-Reads is proud to release the very first complete publication of all Gor books by John Norman, in both print and ebook editions, including the long-awaited 26th novel in the saga, WITNESS OF GOR. Many of the original Gor books have been out of print for years, but their popularity has endured. Each book of this release has been specially edited by the author and is a definitive text.</p><p><p>John Norman, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1931, is the creator of the Gorean Saga, the longest-running series of adventure novels in science fiction history. Starting in December 1966 with "Tarnsman of Gor", the series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment, "Magicians of Gor", in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor, "Witness of Gor". After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001. Norman has also produced a separate, three-installment science fiction series, the Telnarian Histories, plus two other fiction works ("Ghost Dance" and "Time Slave"), a nonfiction paperback ("Imaginative Sex"), and a collection of thirty short stories, entitled "Norman Invasions". "The Totems of Abydos" was published in spring 2012. All of Norman's work is available both in print and as ebooks. The Internet has proven to be a fertile ground for the imagination of Norman's ever-growing fan base, and at Gor Chronicles (www.gorchronicles.com), a website specially created for his tremendous fan following, one may read everything there is to know about this unique fictional culture.

He was named Poet Laureate of New Jersey by the N.J. Commission on Humanities, from 2002-2004. His last two books of poetry, Somebody Blew Up America &amp; Other Poems and Un Poco Low Coup received tremendous critical acclaim.The same rhetorical bomb throwing that drew attention to Baraka for his poem "Who Blew Up America" shoots through these stories written from 1974 through the present. Baraka works over issues of politics, race, sex and the afterlife, though the focus is always on ideas and wordplay. In "Conrad Loomis and the Clothes Ray," the narrator's friend Conrad reveals his new invention, a "clothes ray" that zaps the illusion of natty clothing onto the body of a naked person. Loomis describes himself as "outtelligent," which is superior to plain intelligence because it represents a brightness focused outward rather than inward. He also explains that while most people can understand problems, he can both "over and understand them." Linguistic ticks and characters like Loomis represent the engaging but intellectually imprecise core of this collection. At their best, these stories stretch language and churn out grimly whimsical notions, but Baraka also misfires, tweaking language into meaninglessness, or, for instance, melding <i>The Matrix</i> with hoary 9/11 conspiracy theories. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McNelly, a complex and determined Confederate veteran, is brought into the Nueces Strip for one purpose: to keep the peace. His measures are harsh and controversial--but McNelly wasn't sent in to be popular. In this boilerpot of killing and racial hatred, can any man bring lasting peace?</p></p><p><p><b>Elmer Kelton</b> (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men's Horses</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>. He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956.

He died in 2009.</p>Captain's Rangers <br> One THEY RODE HORSEBACK UP AUSTIN'S broad main thoroughfare toward the forbidding antebellum structure which now, ten years after the Civil War, was being denounced in the legislature as the worst firetrap and eyesore in Texas--the capitol building. There were two riders, a big man with a broad-brimmed Mexican border hat and a little man with a short brown beard. A vague military look--something sensed as much as seen, something about the way he carried himself--made it plain that the smaller man was the one in charge. He rode up almost to the steps and swung down from the saddle. He paused a moment, his thin shoulders pinching as he coughed into one hand. His face was pale and sickly, but his piercing eyes saw all there was to see and gave a hint that behind them a keen mind was running with the whistle tied down. He handed the reins tothe big man and said: "Stay close, Sergeant. I have no idea how long I'll be with the governor." Two men idled on the steps, puffing cigars and arguing about an item in a newspaper. One looked up, frowning. "It's McNelly." He spoke in a voice the little man could not miss. "McNelly?" The other snorted. "Ain't he the one used to work for them damned carpetbag State Police?" McNelly gave no appearance of hearing until the big man took an angry stride toward the loafers. He turned and said, "No, Sergeant. There'll be no brawling on the capitol steps. They didn't say anything, and you didn't hear it." The sergeant glared at the idlers but did not question the order. "Yes, sir, Captain." He watched Captain McNelly march into the building and out of sight. The loafers felt that the order was their protection. One said, "The sergeant don't sound like a carpetbagger to me. Does he to you, Wilse?" "Naw, he don't. Where you from, Sergeant?" Anger stained the big man's face. He ignored the question until it was thrown at him a second time. "Arkansas," he replied curtly. "Arkansas. Well, now, I wouldn't hardly think there'd be no carpetbaggers from Arkansas. I don't see any uniform, either. What kind of a sergeant are you, anyway?" "Ranger sergeant. Texas Rangers." "A Texas Ranger from Arkansas. That does beat all, don't it, Wilse? A carpetbag Texas Ranger sergeant from Arkansas." The sergeant put one booted foot forward, caught himself and stepped back, glancing up at the open windows as if certain the captain would see him. Crisply he declared, "War's been over for ten years. There's no such of a thing anymore as a carpetbagger. Somethin' else, Captain never <i>was</i> one. The man who says differentis a low-down, yellow-bellied liar. And he hasn't got the guts to come to the Ranger camp tonight and meet me out past the picket line." "If a man <i>was</i> to come around, who would you send out to fight him? That consumptive-looking captain of yours?" The sergeant moved forward, fists up. The loafer jumped to his feet. "Remember your orders, Sergeant." The sergeant's eyes narrowed, and his voice went quiet, the way the air sometimes does just before a storm breaks loose. "I'll remember my orders. But I'll also remember you two. And if you're not on the picket line tonight to find me, I'll be around tomorrow to find you." He looked as if he could drive a nail with his bare hand. The loafers decided they were moths too close to the flame. He watched, the color still high in his broad face, as the two retreated down the dirt street and disappeared into the open door of a saloon. He led the horses to a shady place and loosened the cinches, then squatted on the ground. There he could watch both the door of the capitol building and the door of the saloon. He would be here a long time, more than likely, but the captain had said wait. When a man followed McNelly, he learned to rest every time he got the chance, for sometimes there was no rest at all. For a little man, Captain had the devil's own endurance, except when he was suffering one of his spells. The sergeant half dozed in the gentle warmth of the spring morning, but every movement at the capitol door caught his eye. He was sure the loafers had not left the saloon, either. After perhaps two hours, he saw the familiar gaunt figure pass through the doorway and start down the long steps, back straight, thin shoulders held proud. The sergeantled the horses forward. He could tell McNelly was troubled by the way he chewed his unlighted cigar. The sergeant boiled with curiosity, but a man never asked the captain unnecessary questions. If Captain wanted something known, he would tell it. If he chose to keep it to himself, all hell couldn't prize it out of him. His men learned to watch him and take their cue from his actions. If he ate a good supper, they knew they could figure on sleeping. If he drank coffee and munched a little hardtack, they knew a night ride was coming up, for Captain believed a man traveled best when he rode with his belly lank. Captain asked, "Do you have any business in Austin that needs settling before we leave, Sergeant?" The sergeant hadn't known they were going anywhere, but then, he doubted the governor had called McNelly in to talk about the old days of the Confederacy. "That depends, sir. I take it we'll be gone before tonight?" "My orders are to leave when I'm ready. And I'm ready." The sergeant frowned. "Well, sir, there is one little piece of business I ought to take care of. Won't be but a minute or two. I have a small debt that needs settlin' in that saloon." "All right, but no drinking. We've got to ride." "No drinkin', sir." The sergeant dismounted. He held the reins awkwardly until the captain silently reached out for them. Under no circumstances would the sergeant have presumed to <i>ask</i> Captain to hold his horse. He walked into the saloon. Two minutes later he was back smiling, rubbing the knuckles of his right hand against his shirt. In his left hand he held several black cigars. "For you, Captain. Compliments of the bartender." "Thank you, Sergeant. Debt all paid?" "Paid in full, sir." He knew better than to ask where they were going. But there were ways of fishing for an answer. "Spring like this, it could still get chilly up in North Texas. Somebody stole my coat. Reckon I ought to buy me a new one, sir?" "We're not heading north." The little captain's sharp eyes held a rare glint of dark humor, and the sergeant knew McNelly saw through him. "We're going south." "I didn't mean to pry, Captain." "You had just as well know. I find the rumor is out anyway. The governor has authorized me to recruit new men and build up my force for a cleanup job. It'll be a dirty one." The sergeant struggled against his curiosity, but he couldn't keep it from showing. The captain could see. "We're going all the way to the Rio Grande. Our orders are to clean up the Nueces Strip."

They want something comfortable they can wear for years.<br><br>So join knitter extraordinaire Erika Knight as she takes on the knitwear that men love. Knight started her career designing menswear and over the decades she&#x2019;s completely figured out their clothes-buying mentality. In <i>Men&#x2019;s Knits</i>, she applies that expertise to come up with 20 projects that guys are sure to wear. Using classic shapes, a mostly neutral palette (but with some teals and chocolates thrown in for the slightly flashier guy), and natural yarns like wool, bamboo, and hemp, every piece is distinctive and stylish. <br><br>For men young and old, these designs will become the sweaters, vests, scarves, and hats they reach for again and again. The zipper cardigan is perfect for both reading the paper on Sunday morning and a casual dinner with friends on Sunday night. The herringbone sweater will impress his future boss at his next interview, or his future in-laws at their next family gathering. The argyle vest works on every man, whether he&#x2019;s buttoned-up or laid back. Together, they&#x2019;ll be the new classics you&#x2019;ll want to knit, give, and maybe even borrow for years to come. <br><br>Whether it&#x2019;s a textured vest or a hand-dyed sweater, you&#x2019;re sure to find something that&#x2019;ll look good on the man in your life&#x2013;and not end up forever buried in his bureau.</p><p>Renowned knitwear designer ERIKA KNIGHT is the author of more than ten acclaimed craft books including <i>Simple Crochet</i> and <i>Classic Knits</i>. She currently resides in Brighton, England.*Starred Review* What does it take to make a new classic sweater? The answers are: attention to detail; meticulously following directions; using luxurious yarns such as alpaca, cashmere, and even hemp; and creating shapes that echo the training of world-renowned British author-designer Knight, who puts her background in menswear tailoring to the best of all possible uses, sharing 20 patterns exclusively for men. The first chapter delves into more know-how than how-to&#x2019;s; its contents cover types of yarn and garment care, not casting on and off or the stitches of knitting and purling. The rest of her book showcases 25 men and a dog (Rufus) wearing 20 sharp, well-designed knits that will look good no matter the man&#x2019;s age or size. In fact, all patterns&#x2014;in addition to materials, gauge, and directions&#x2014;feature full-color finished photographs of the garment worn by different male models. Count these among Knight&#x2019;s new classics: an ombre-striped full zip cardigan; a bulked-up collegiate cable sweater; and vests in plain style, argyle, or checkered patterns.

She lives near Boston.Leather-bound five-year diaries were once popular gifts at children's birthday parties, sometimes providing the first taste of a lifelong pleasure. While an estimated 12 million journals are sold annually, Johnson, a teacher of creative nonfiction at Harvard and Wellesley, has found that people also record their lives on dinner napkins, menus, slips of paper and, increasingly, the computer. In her follow-up to The Hidden Writer, for which she won a PEN Award, she proffers advice for journal keepers who want to develop material for later books or who simply enjoy logging life's events. Commiserating on diaries abandoned as "joyless collections of grievances," she offers tips on how to "break the deadlock of introspective obsession." She advises perfectionists on how to silence their censorD"that dark, icy whisper of the confidence thief." Apt remarks by Virginia Woolf, Tobias Wolff, Annie Dillard and others add to her perceptive and often humorous insights on unearthing the interior life, improving observation skills and finding images that reveal significant motivations. The transformation of a factual log into a creative work requires investigating essential patterns: disclosing what has been left out of memory, charting periods of great intensity and connecting the dots between events and influences to develop a true narrative. Because a journal is usually a private affair that offers little opportunity for discussion, people seeking direction on keeping a successful one should welcome this thoughtful guidebook. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey</h2><p>The reader, as a participant in the story, can discover who killed the wealthy industrialist only by making the right decisions</p><p></p><h2>Vino, I Love You</h2><p>Oscar Farinetti is currently considered one of Italy's greatest entrepreneurs, a visionary, able to export "Made in Italy" anywhere. <i>Vino, I Love You</i> comes from an intuition, or rather from a conviction, according to which, fine food and wine, as symbols of economy, culture and above all beauty, will save Italy from the current economic crisis.<br><br>In this book, we meet 12 of the most praiseworthy wine producers of our time on a journey from the North to the South of Italy, which, step by step, brings you face to face with the minds of extraordinary men and women who have had the courage to bet on the "land" to become driving forces of the future.

Gene Wolfe, of whom The Washington Post said, Of all SF writers currently active none is held in higher esteem, has selected the short fiction he considers his finest into one volume. There are many award winners and many that have been selected for various Year s Best anthologies among the thirty-one stories, which include: Petting Zoo, The Tree Is My Hat, The Island of Dr. Death and Other Stories, The Hero as Werewolf, Seven American Nights, The Fifth Head of Cerberus, The Detective of Dreams, and A Cabin on the Coast. Gene Wolfe has produced possibly the finest and most significant body of short fiction in the SF and fantasy field in the last fifty years, and is certainly among the greatest living writers to emerge from the genres</p><p><p>Gene Wolfe&nbsp;is winner of the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, and many other awards. In 2007, he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. He lives in Barrington, Illinois.</p>Thirty-one stories by the most distinguished creator of literary sf makes for a pretty indispensable volume. Of course, &#x201c;The Fifth Head of Cerberus&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Island of Doctor Death and Other Stories&#x201d;&#x2014;recognized as classics for many years now&#x2014;are here.

A. Lafferty (1914&#x2013;2002). Each of those and the rest of these stories characteristically begin at a point from which Wolfe diverges in a number of different directions&#x2014;with just how many depending, surprisingly enough, on the particular reader. By the time one has, preferably slowly, digested Wolfe&#x2019;s creativity, one could be humming Gilbert and Sullivan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Things Are Seldom What They Seem&#x201d; and rejoicingly remarking, &#x201c;with Wolfe, too.&#x201d; --Roland Green</p><h2>Surrendering the Secret: Healing the Heartbreak of Abortion (Picking Up the Pieces Series)</h2><p><p><b>Surrendering the Secret: Healing the Heartbreak of Abortion - Learner Guide</b> by <b>Pat Layton</b> provides a personal study experience helping hurting women find the path to healing through honest, interactive Bible study; meaningful group experiences; unique journaling exercises; and confidential, caring community. </p><p>Many women hide the secret of abortion deep in their hearts and they are suffering severe consequences.

This is an easily accessible and honest study of remarkable events which proved to be less than supernatural and makes a handy reference source or ground point to compare possible paranormalities with known tricks and hoaxes.<i>RBB</i> has reviewed several books advocating occult views recently, for example, <i>Encyclopedia of Afterlife Beliefs and Phenomena</i> [<i>RBB</i> Ap 15 95] and <i>Divining the Future</i> (in this issue). Here is one debunking the occult. Described as "James Randi's decidedly skeptical definitions of alternate realities," it includes an introduction by Arthur C. Clarke. Some entries just define terms (<i>anima mundi</i>, <i>ankh</i>, and <i>kachina</i>), but many of the approximately 700 entries attempt to expose people and movements Randi sees as frauds (e.g., L. Ron Hubbard, Madame Blavatsky, crystals, channeling, pyramid power). Many entries are loaded with sarcasm. For example, the author says that in modern times, witchcraft "is a harmless distraction for otherwise idle persons to embrace." He does, however, point out that many practices erroneously attributed to witchcraft are really related to followers of satanism. Randi goes on to say that "homeopathy . . . falls into the category of magic." He is much kinder to acupuncture, merely describing it and including a diagram of acupuncture points. After describing the chanting practices of Hare Krishnas, he concludes, "It is <i>very</i> boring." Appendixes debunk the "Curse of King Tut" and end-of-the-world prophecies. A bibliography lists other skeptical books on the occult. <i>See also</i> references and an index make access easy. Illustrations consist of black-and-white photographs and drawings.<p>Readers who have occult beliefs will be dismayed and annoyed by what they read here, but libraries that want to provide balance in their collections will find this an antidote to the many recent reference books promoting the occult. <i></i></p></p><h2>Silent Steppe: The Memoir of a Kazakh Nomad Under Stalin</h2><p>Documents the tragic story of the Kazakh nomads of central Asia under Stalin&#39;s regime, offering insight into the culture&#39;s Islamic and pagan heritage, the ancient traditions that established their nomadic way of life, and the author&#39;s family&#39;s struggle to relocate and survive after his father was fatally incarcerated within a prison camp. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Mukhamet Shayakhmetov was a member of a traditional Kazakh nomadic tribe.

She lives outside of Atlanta with her family.<i>It&#x2019;s time...<br></i><br>Emma&#x2019;s voice rose from the past, encircling Rhoda and bringing a wave of guilt.

She quickly looked beyond the picket fence that enclosed her fruit and herb garden but saw no one. Her shoulders relaxed.

Even family members frowned upon it and asked her to stop.<br><br><i>It&#x2019;s time...<br></i><br>Emma&#x2019;s gentle voice echoed around her for a second time. &#x201c;Time for what?&#x201d; Rhoda repeated, more a prayer to God than a question to her departed sister.<br><br>God was the One who spoke in whispers to the soul, not the dead. But whenever Rhoda heard a murmuring in her mind, it was Emma&#x2019;s voice. It had been that way since the day Emma died.<br><br>The sound of two people talking near the road caught Rhoda&#x2019;s attention. Surely they were real. She rose out of her crouch, pressing her bare feet into the rich soil, and went in the direction of the voices, passing the long rows of strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries and her trellises of raspberries and Concord grapes. Heady scents rode on the spring air, not just from the ripening fruits, but from her bountiful herb garden that yielded rosemary, sage, scarlet<br>bergamot, and dozens of other plants she&#x2019;d spent years cultivating. Dusting her palms together, she skirted the raised boxes that held the herbs and peered through a honeysuckle bush.<br><br>She was relieved to see actual people speaking to each other. Then she recognized them, and her fingertips tingled as her pulse raced. Her mother&#x2019;s eldest sister walked beside Rueben Glick, a man who wanted to make her life<br>miserable.<br><br>&#x201c;Surely her Daed will listen to me this time.&#x201d; Aunt Naomi clutched her fists tightly. &#x201c;He indulges her. That&#x2019;s the real problem.&#x201d;<br><br>Rhoda had no doubt they were talking about her. Since Emma&#x2019;s death two years ago, the church leaders had avoided responding to all the trouble that Rhoda caused, however unintentional. They offered grace and mercy as her family tried to deal with their grief from the tragedy. But Rueben and Naomi made it their responsibility to keep Rhoda&#x2019;s family aware of how the Amish and non-Amish in Morgansville felt about her.<br><br>&#x201c;I can bring a witness this time, more if need be.&#x201d; Rueben&#x2019;s tone was confident, with a familiar edge of bitterness.<br><br>More than anyone else in Morgansville, Rueben detested her. But unlike the others, he was only too happy to speak his mind directly to her and her family. And Rhoda knew why. He wanted to make her pay for turning his girlfriend against him. Rhoda had plenty of things to feel guilty for, but Rueben losing his girlfriend was not one of them.<br><br>Her aunt paused at the corner of the fence, studying Rhoda&#x2019;s house. &#x201c;There should be no need for a witness, especially from those who are not Amish.

She never even shared with her family her comings and goings based on intuition. Dread pressed in on her, and she bit back her growing contempt for Rueben Glick.<br><br>&#x201c;Kumm.&#x201d; Her aunt crossed the driveway with Rueben right beside her. Naomi tapped on the screen door and waited. The fact that she didn&#x2019;t let herself in was a sign of the troubled feelings between her Daed and his sister-in-law.<br><br>Not counting Rhoda, six adults and five children were living in the house right now&#x2014;her parents, two of her brothers, and their wives and children. Regardless which adult answered the door, Naomi and Rueben would take up matters concerning Rhoda only with her father.<br><br>Mamm came to the door and invited her sister and Rueben into the house. Rhoda moved out from behind the honeysuckle bush, curiosity and anxiety mixing inside her. What accusation did Rueben have against her this time?Regardless of the new charge, this visit would put more tension inside an already overloaded household and would only isolate her more. No matter how many people lived with her or how deeply loyal they were, she stood on an<br>island by herself, forbidden to acknowledge the largest part of who she was. She meandered toward the gate, running her fingertips across the various herbs as she went. A few bloomed now, in May, but come July these plants would be bursting with vivid color. More important, they would provide people with natural relief from certain illnesses. She paused in front of the red clover, but despite its name, this particular clover was splashed with lovely purple blooms.<br><br>Many of these plants&#x2014;the clover, dandelion, and thistle, to name a few&#x2014;were considered nuisances. Like Rhoda herself. But each herb offered health benefits under the right circumstances. Maybe she was like them in that way<br>too. Her people used to believe her, used to trust her with their health. If they would only give her a chance, perhaps she could help them again.<br><br>&#x201c;Rhodes?&#x201d;<br><br>She blinked, coming out of her thoughts and realizing that someone had been calling her name. She turned toward the road that ran along one side of her berry patch.<br><br>Landon was sitting in his old pickup on the main road, banging on the door. Officially, he worked for her, but he was also one of her few friends.<br><br>&#x201c;There she is, back from Oz again.&#x201d;<br><br>Although she hadn&#x2019;t seen the movie, he&#x2019;d explained enough that she understood Oz was somehow connected to witches. And he was talking about it out loud, right here in the thick of busy Morgansville. She put her index finger to her lips.<br><br>Landon grinned. &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m hushing&#x2014;not that it&#x2019;ll do any good.&#x201d;<br><br>A short line of cars stacked up behind him, and someone honked. He drove forward twenty feet and pulled into her driveway. Once out of his truck, he walked toward her. &#x201c;In my two years of working for you, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever seen you doing nothing while standing inside this garden.&#x201d; Before opening the gate, he grabbed one of the empty baskets stacked outside the picket fence. &#x201c;What has you so distracted?&#x201d;<br><br>She turned away and walked down the long path at the end of the rows. &#x201c;Just wondering if I ordered enough canning supplies to last through the month.&#x201d; She kept her back to him so he couldn&#x2019;t read her face and know she was fibbing. She returned to her strawberry bush, crouched down, and began dumping more of the velvety fruit into her basket.<br><br>He went to the other side of the row and started picking. &#x201c;You were studying the red clover. Rotating it out seems like it was a good idea. Looks like we&#x2019;ll get a bumper crop this year. That should give you lots for making that ointment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ya,&#x201d; she mumbled, wishing she knew what was going on inside her house. Did Rueben have proof that she&#x2019;d disobeyed the church authorities and her parents?<br><br>When the back door slammed, she jolted. But it was just one of her sistersin-law taking another load of freshly cleaned diapers to the clothesline. &#x201c;First you&#x2019;re in la-la land, and then you jump at nothing. What gives, Rhodes?&#x201d;<br><br>Landon knew her better than most. Emma had once known her best, but what good had that done Emma? If Rhoda had been half the sister Emma deserved, she would still be alive.<br><br>Rhoda moved the basket down the row. &#x201c;How are things at the mail store today?&#x201d; Maybe if she got him answering questions rather than asking them, she could avoid his probing. The tactic worked most days.<br><br>&#x201c;Still slow. If the economy doesn&#x2019;t pick up soon, working for you may be the only job I have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wish I could afford to pay you for more hours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me too, although both of us in that tiny cellar working long hours week after week might cause one of us to disagree with the other, ya?&#x201d; His grin lifted her spirits a little.<br><br>One of the things she enjoyed about Landon was his ability to speak his mind with total honesty. She loved truthfulness between people. Stark. Radiant. And powerful.<br><br>Unfortunately, it seemed to be in short supply&#x2014;from her most of all.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on with you today?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t lie to me, Rhoda.&#x201d;<br><br>His use of her real name caught her attention, and she turned to face him. He pointed at his eyes, demanding she look at him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your fault.&#x201d; She stared at him. Would she ever be able to believe that? Since Emma&#x2019;s death, she hadn&#x2019;t found one moment when she could accept it as true. There was nothing she could do to free herself. And if he knew everything she did, he wouldn&#x2019;t say that to her.<br><br>Images flashed through her mind&#x2014;fire trucks, policemen with guns strapped to their hips, groups of women whispering on the sidewalk. Even now, a crushing sense of guilt and panic rose within her again.<br><br>All her sister had wanted was for Rhoda to help her bake a cake for their Daed&#x2019;s birthday. And Rhoda had promised she would. Throughout the morning Emma kept asking Rhoda to stop weeding her garden and to go buy the items they needed. Even though she was seventeen years old, Emma hated going places by herself. Strangers frightened her. And Rhoda kept putting her off, assuring her they&#x2019;d have a great time making the dessert when she was finished tending the garden.<br><br>Finally, fed up with waiting, in an unusual act of self-reliance, Emma stormed off to the store without Rhoda, her eyes filled with tears.<br><br>A strawberry flew through the air and hit Rhoda on the shoulder, followed in quick succession by a second and a third one. &#x201c;Stay with me, Rhodes,&#x201d; Landon called to her.<br><br>She blinked. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You tried to save her, almost broke your leg&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rueben&#x2019;s here.&#x201d; Rhoda had no desire to listen to Landon&#x2019;s version of that day. She wasn&#x2019;t a hero. More like a murderer. And what she&#x2019;d done had divided this town, making both Amish and Englisch distrust and fear her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s inside with my aunt Naomi.&#x201d;<br><br>Landon chuckled. &#x201c;On a witch hunt again, I take it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not even a little bit funny, Landon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Rhodes. You know I tease because it&#x2019;s all so ridiculous. Gimme a smile. You can&#x2019;t change what they think. What&#x2019;s Rueben&#x2019;s problem now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Remember when several Amish communities were at that regional function a couple of months ago?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Your Mamm insisted you go, and you came back with your feathers ruffled at Rueben. But that&#x2019;s about all I know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He spent two days harassing me and making fun of me. On the second day he got bolder, saying things to me he shouldn&#x2019;t, in front of a large group of singles, including his girlfriend. He was being a bully, and I lashed out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you say to him?&#x201d;<br><br>She picked up her basket, ready to head toward the gate. &#x201c;I looked into his eyes and knew a secret he wasn&#x2019;t telling anyone. His guilt was easy to see&#x2014;if anyone had a mind to look. I called him on seeing another girl while he was out<br>of state helping some Amish farmers. He denied it at first, but I knew when he was telling the truth and when he was lying by the guilt on his face. He thought that I&#x2019;d spoken to the girl directly, that maybe she&#x2019;d come to this area, and he owned up to his cheating. As I walked off, I let him know that I had no proof whatsoever, that he&#x2019;d simply told on himself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rhodes, you didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>At times she picked up on silly, nonsensical stuff without even realizing it&#x2014;an aroma from someone&#x2019;s past or a distorted image in place of the person in front of her. But that didn&#x2019;t stop her from relying on a reasonable intuition<br>when it came to her.<br><br>&#x201c;He asked for it, taunting me, saying if I knew anything, Emma would still be alive. Daring me to tell his fortune. He was vicious, and I gave him what he deserved.&#x201d; She set the basket on the ground. &#x201c;But ever since, I think he&#x2019;s been scheming ways to force me out of this garden. Biding his time and planning carefully. That&#x2019;s more wrong than anything I did to him. I make my living off these fruits.&#x201d;<br><br>Landon brushed a gnat away from his face. &#x201c;You think he can do something to take away your business?&#x201d;<br><br>She padded across the warm dirt to her raised beds of herbs, drawn to them like bees to pollen. This was her favorite part of the garden. The medicinal plants in particular. Each one had properties that could help people whose bodies hurt as much physically as her heart did emotionally. Whenever people were strengthened through the power of her herbs, she felt strengthened too. Landon joined her.<br><br>&#x201c;I followed my instincts again. And it sounds as if Rueben has proof.&#x201d;<br><br>Landon rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Geez, Rhodes, why would you do that? You know you either have to do what your people expect or get out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And go where, Landon? To the Englisch? They fear me just as much as my people do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then move somewhere else. Start new.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And leave more holes in my parents&#x2019; hearts? They&#x2019;ve lost enough. I can&#x2019;t do something that selfish.&#x201d;<br><br>As she walked the row of herb beds, warm memories of her childhood, of laughter, and of fun-filled days rose within her. &#x201c;I was seven when my Daed bought each of his daughters a blueberry bush and an herb plant. Did I ever tell<br>you that?&#x201d;<br><br>A slight grin lifted one side of his mouth. Nothing like being a paid employee who had to listen when the boss wanted to vent or reminisce. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve only mentioned it a couple of times.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He helped each of us plant his gifts. But as the days moved into weeks, my three teenage sisters were more interested in their friends or boys than gardening, and they neglected their gifts. Emma wasn&#x2019;t even four at the time, and she only cared about dolls and playing house. But I adored tending to those plants. And every birthday and Christmas since then, Daed has bought me at least one new bush, herb, or gardening tool.&#x201d; And every year that she proved faithful in what he&#x2019;d given, he allowed her a little more land to expand her garden until she now had every spare inch of ground they owned.<br><br>&#x201c;I understand why you don&#x2019;t want to leave your folks. But either keep a low profile and don&#x2019;t make waves in the community or be willing to leave. It&#x2019;s that simple.&#x201d;<br><br>She inhaled the sweet aroma of her apple mint plants. What a multipurpose herb. It repelled nuisance insects while attracting beneficial ones. Was flavorful in dozens of drinks. Aided indigestion and stomachaches. Eased the pain and swelling of insect bites. Relieved morning sickness in pregnant women. It was even alleged to calm the nerves and clear the head. She&#x2019;d like to be in her cellar sipping a cup of mint tea right now.<br><br>&#x201c;So what did you do this time, Rhodes?&#x201d;<br><br>She thought back to the events that had probably led to this latest uprising. &#x201c;Not long after I got back in town, I was on one of my long walks, and as I passed a home, I had a strong sensation to go up to the door. I stood on the sidewalk, trying to talk myself out of following that feeling. But I sensed the woman inside the house needed someone. So I rang the doorbell. We got to know each other a bit. She talked about feeling anxious and depressed, but I knew she&#x2019;d been entertaining the idea of suicide. She&#x2019;s a young mom with three children and a husband ...</p><h2>Meet the Beatles: A Cultural History of the Band That Shook Youth, Gender, and the World</h2><p><p>Here they are&#x2014;John, Paul, George, Ringo&#x2014;the band that inspired and changed popular culture forever. In this revealing and provocative new account, Steven D. Stark puts their impact into unique perspective by revealing both the personal details and the larger events that made them into the twentieth century's greatest cultural force.</p><p>"They were magic," said their producer George Martin, and most of us would agree. But the band has become so shrouded in cultural mythology that it is difficult today to really understand how or why. This book explains that why&#x2014;unpacking the legendary band's aura and examining the ways in which the Beatles' own lives were inextricably tied to the cultural, youth, and gender revolutions they helped create and lead during the 1960s.</p><p>Based on extensive research and more than a hundred new interviews, <em>Meet the Beatles</em> offers a compelling fresh interpretation of their story, beginning with their childhoods in England and the profound effect on their outlook and music caused by the deaths of Paul's and John's mothers when they were young. It documents their subsequent special bond with women&#x2014;from their teenage fans to the mothers of their friends to close partners Linda and Yoko. It illustrates the central importance of drugs, both for them and the youthful counterculture they led; why their unusual hairstyles set off a cultural revolution; how the band came to create a new vision of the role of women; and the unique conditions that allowed these four to conquer America faster than any other cultural phenomenon in history. It explains why the group's popularity has never faded&#x2014;even now, more than four decades after they first hit the charts.</p><p>From Liverpool and Hamburg to Ed Sullivan and Shea Stadium, it's all here&#x2014;from the improbable decision to fire their original drummer and bring Ringo into the band to why they broke up and who was responsible. After reading <em>Meet the Beatles</em>, you'll never think about the Beatles or listen to their songs the same way again. Live the magic once more.</p></p><p><p>The Beatles have profoundly touched the lives of millions. But have you ever wondered why? Why did they become the most powerful artists in history and one of the twentieth century's major symbols of cultural transformation? <em>Meet the Beatles</em> answers those questions and more as it examines the ways the lives of John, Paul, George, and Ringo were inextricably tied to the cultural revolutions their music helped inspire. From their long hair and interest in India to their drug use and admiration for strong women, the Beatles changed the way we look, the way we feel, and even the way we think. This is the book for those who have always been infatuated with the Beatles, as well as those who want to learn for the first time what it all really meant.</p><p>Steven D.

It's 14-year-olds who enter high school with a decade of football experience, 9-year-olds competing for national baseball championships, 5-year-old golfers who shoot par, and toddlers made from sperm donated (for a fee) by elite college athletes. It's a year-round "travel team" in every community--and parents who fear that not making the cut in grade school will cost their kid the chance to play in high school. In short, a landscape in which performance often matters more than participation, all the way down to peewee basketball.</p><p>Much as <em>Fast Food Nation</em> challenged our eating habits and <em>Silent Spring</em> rewired how we think about the environment, Tom Farrey's <em>Game On</em> will forever change the way we look at this desperate culture besotted by the example of Tiger Woods. An Emmy award-winning reporter, Farrey examines the lives of child athletes and the consequences of sorting the strong from the weak at ever earlier ages: fewer active kids, testier sidelines, rising obesity rates, and U.S. national teams that rarely win world titles.</p><p>He dives into the world of these games that are played by more than 30 million boys and girls, and along the way uncovers some surprising truths. When the very best athletes enter organized play. The best approach to coaching them. And the powerful influence of wealth and genetics.

There are Cleave&#x2019;s memories, which seem to rise up out of the house itself: of the years during his childhood when his mother took in boarders; of the beginnings, and the beginnings-of-the-end, of his career and his marriage; of the course of his relationship with his now estranged daughter; and of his father, who committed suicide when Cleave was still a boy. There are the corporeal, but illicit, inhabitants of the house: the caretaker, an unsettling presence &#x201c;with the ageless aspect of a wastrel son,&#x201d; and the fifteen-year-old housekeeper, a &#x201c;voluptuary of indolence.&#x201d; And there are the apparitions (ghosts? premonitions? visitations?)&#x2014;a woman, a child, and a third, ill-defined figure&#x2014;who Cleave feels are &#x201c;intricately involved in the problem of whatever it is that has gone wrong with me.&#x201d;<br><br>Struggling to determine what exactly has gone wrong, and to understand what part the apparitions play in his life and he in theirs, Cleave slowly comes to see the ways in which things and people&#x2014;himself included&#x2014;are not what they seem, and the ways in which, inevitably, they reveal what they are.<br><br>Brilliantly conjured and realized, Eclipse is John Banville at his unique best.</p><p>In this deeply moving and original book, John Banville alloys mystery, fable, and ghost story with poignant psychological acuity to forge the riveting story of a man wary of the future, plagued by the past, and so uncertain in the present that he cannot discern the spectral from the real. <br>When renowned actor Alexander Cleave was a boy living in a large house with his widowed mother and various itinerant lodgers, he encountered a strikingly vivid ghost of his father.

Some are afraid they are praying wrong. Some want a formula. Some think their prayers are unworthy. Here, Iyanla shares the realizations that changed her experience with prayer once and for all: Every thought, every word, every action is a prayer; focus on God's presence in everything -- and everyone -- and prayer becomes as natural as breathing.<br> <br>The prayers in <i>Everyday I Pray</i> culled from Iyanla's own prayer journal, address a variety of topics and situations.

With this intimate collection, she invites readers everywhere to join her in making the thoughts, words, and deeds of everyday life more reverent, honorable, and loving.</p><p>Rev. Dr. Iyanla Vanzant, author and internationally renowned speaker, is best known for her riveting work as the host of <i>Iyanla Fix My Life</i> on the OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network). Oprah herself has called Iyanla, <i>&#x201c;the most powerful spiritual healer, fixer, teacher, on the planet.&#x201d;</i>&nbsp; Oprah Winfrey has publicly acknowledged that Fix My Life and Iyanla was the turning point for the fledgling Oprah Winfrey Network. Susan Taylor, former editor-in-chief of <i>Essence</i> magazine calls her, <i>&#x201c;The real deal,&#x201d;</i> in the arena of personal healing and spiritual growth.&#x201d;&nbsp; Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i> says, <i>&#x201c;Iyanla is a walking, talking, miracle in heels, who carries the energy to heal the masses.&#x201d; </i>Many of the 2.8 million people who follow her on Facebook lovingly call her, <i>&#x201c;auntie,&#x201d;</i> yet if you ask Iyanla she would say, &#x201c;<i>I am just an ordinary person committed to doing extraordinary things as a demonstration of what is possible when you love God, have faith in yourself, and trust the amazing process called life.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>As the Founder and Executive Director of the Inner Visions Institute for Spiritual Development, Iyanla conducts workshops and classes around the country, throughout Africa and the UK.

Her latest venture, the creation of MasterPeace Body Therapy, a line of natural body care products has received rave reviews on HSN.<br> <br>Cooking and making scrapbooks are her guilty pleasures. Studying the Bible and other sacred texts is the foundation of her life. Iyanla cherishes her collection of over 100 Bibles in various translations. Watching re-runs of <i>Law and Order </i>is her joy. Spending time with her grandchildren and doing her own laundry is what keeps her grounded. Knowing that she is on purpose; loving what she does; doing everything with excellence; is what Iyanla Vanzant says makes her the woman that she is today.Prayer is "an inner communion with the divine" and should be "as natural as breathing," writes spirituality diva Vanzant, author of the bestselling In the Meantime, in this collection drawn from her ongoing "Prayer Journal." There's undeniable energy (and a lot of exclamation points) in Vanzant's personal entreaties; she's fond of ringing but generic affirmations of God (who is "awesome," "magnificent," "amazing" and "a skilled negotiator") and self ("I praise my body! I love my body!"). "Every thought, every word, every action is a prayer," Vanzant says, but she still offers specifics: there are prayers for "Alignment with God" and for blessing married couples; to "Eliminate Tiredness or Exhaustion" and to give thanks. Her fervent desire for the Divine presence in every facet of life will be inspiring for many, but others might find her detailed invocations ("Teach me to monitor my thoughts and desires to ensure that they are filled with love, harmony and peace for myself and everyone in my life in all situations and under all circumstances"; "Please purge my agenda today. Take out of my life everything...that could possibly take my focus from you") a trifle demanding. Replete with "I" statements, many of her prayers seem self-absorbed; the longer, more reflective ones, such as "Prayer When Ending a Relationship" and "God's Promise" strike deeper chords. Vanzant's spirituality of is powerful and motivating, as is her rags-to-riches bio, but occasionally this volume seems as much about her as it is about God.

Schwartz tells a tale of genius and greed, innocence and deceit, and corporate arrogance versus independent brilliance. In other words, the very qualities that have made this country -- for better or for worse -- what it is. <br>Many men have laid claim to the title "The Father of Television" but Philo T. Farnsworth is the true genius behind what may be the most influential invention of our time. Farnsworth may have ended up a footnote in history, yet he was the first to demonstrate an electronic process for scanning, transmitting and receiving moving images, a discovery that changed the way we live. <br>Growing up on a small farm in Idaho, Farnsworth was fascinated by anything scientific, especially the newest thing on the market -- radio. Wouldn't it be even more miraculous to project images along with the sound? Driven by his obsession, Farnsworth found a local philanthropist willing to fund his dream. By the age of twenty, in 1926, Farnsworth was operating his own laboratory above a garage in San Francisco and filing his first patent applications. The resulting publicity brought him to the attention of David Sarnoff, the celebrated founder of the NBC radio network, whose own RCA laboratories soon began investigating -- without much success -- a way to transmit a moving image. Determined to control television the way he monopolized radio -- by owning all the royalty producing patents--Sarnoff, from the lofty heights of his office in a New York skyscraper, devised a plan to steal credit for Farnsworth's designs. <br>Vividly written, and based on original research, including interviews with surviving members of the Farnsworth family <i>The Last Lone Inventor</i> is the story of the epic struggle between two equally passionate adversaries and how their clash symbolized a turning point in the culture of creativity.</p><p><p>To write <em>THE LAST LONE INVENTOR,</em> Evan I. Schwartz spent two years researching the life stories of Philo T. Farnsworth and David Sarnoff. He interviewed surviving Farnsworth family members, including Farnsworth's 93-year-old widow, and he visited document archives in six states. </p><p>As a journalist, Evan has been covering information technology for 15 years. He is a former editor at <em>BusinessWeek,</em> where he covered software and digital media and was part of teams that produced 12 cover stories and won a National Magazine Award and a Computer Press Award. In recent years, he has written for <em>The New York Times, WIRED,</em> and MIT's <em>Technology Review.</em> </p><p>Evan's first book, titled WEBONOMICS, published by Broadway Books, a division of Random House, has ranked as Amazon.com's #1 bestselling business book and was chosen as a finalist for two major awards: The Global Business Book Award as well as the Computer Press Award. International editions have been published in eight countries. </p><p>Evan's second book, <em>DIGITAL DARWINISM,</em> from the same publisher, also hit #1 on Amazon's business list shortly after its release, in June 1999. Now in its twelfth hardcover and first paperback printing in the U.S., it is available in the U.K., from Penguin, and has been translated into eight other languages. It too was named a finalist for the Computer Press Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year. </p><p>Evan holds a B.S. in computer science from Union College in Schenectady, New York, and lives with his family in Brookline, Mass.</p>This is a lively and engaging account of the conception and invention of both television and the system of network broadcasting in the United States. Schwartz (Digital Darwinism, Webonomics) tells the stories of Philo T. Farnsworth, who essentially invented television before he was 30, and David Sarnoff, the founder of NBC, who essentially invented the business of broadcasting before he was 30. These two men were at tremendous odds with each other for decades, and the nature of their conflict helped determine the shape of the U.S. broadcasting industry. While many other works document the beginnings of broadcast media, they tend to be overviews, offering less of a personal story. This book complements D. Godfrey and C. Sterling's Philo T. Farnsworth: The Father of Television, which takes a drier, more academic approach to the inventor's life and work and should be of interest to academic libraries, particularly those with a technology or engineering department. Schwartz's well-researched biography is sure to appeal to anyone who has ever dreamed of coming up with "the next big thing." Recommended for public libraries and academic or special libraries with a media or technology focus.

In <i>The Ghosts of Galway</i>, he brings those elegiac talents to bear on a case involving a famously blasphemous red book and Bruen&#x2019;s equally profane antihero Jack Taylor.<br><br>As well-versed in politics, pop culture, and crime fiction as he is ill-fated in life, Jack Taylor is recovering from a mistaken medical diagnosis and a failed suicide attempt. In need of money, and with former cop on his resume, Jack has been hired as a night-shift security guard. But his Ukrainian boss has Jack in mind for a bit of off-the-books work. He wants Jack to find what some claim to be the first true book of heresy, <i>The Red Book</i>, currently in the possession of a rogue priest who is hiding out in Galway after fleeing a position at the Vatican. Despite Jack&#x2019;s distaste for priests of any stripe, the money is too good to turn down.

Lewis: Letters to Children</h2><p>From dust jacket notes: &#34;...Today&#39;s readers can now meet the creator of the magical world of Narnia, who described himself as a &#39;tall, fat, rather bald, red-faced, double-chinned, black-haired&#39; man with a deep voice and reading glasses. Through his letters Lewis shared with his young correspondents his feelings about school (he hated math), writing, and animals. And of course, he talked about Narnia, explaining why there are only seven books in the Chronicles, how to pronounce Aslan&#39;s name, and whether Susan will be able to return to Narnia. What emerges from this captivating collection are Lewis&#39;s clear understanding of childhood and the respect he felt for his young readers. As he once said: &#39;I don&#39;t think age matters so much as people think. Parts of me are still 12, and I think other parts were already 50 when I was 12.&#39;...&#34;</p><p>C.S. Lewis was a professor of medieval and Renaissance literature at Oxford and Cambridge universities who wrote more than thirty books in his lifetime, including <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and <i>Mere Christianity</i>.

Most children will skip the foreword by Lewis' stepson and the brief sketch of Lewis' childhood (although both are accessible to young readers) and go straight to the letters themselvesa selection arranged chronologically, with some deletions to promote clarity and eliminate repetition. Most of the letters concern Narnia, but there are also touching letters to Lewis' godchild. Some letters offer encouragement and advice to young writers. Often correspondence was carried on with the same children over a number of years, and the letters answer questions that children might still have. Some letters are preceded by explanations in brackets, and there are plenty of explanatory footnotes. Lewis' few theological discussions are not overwhelming and, except for a few instances, are quite clear. The bibliography includes books and other media and is divided into two sections, one of interest to children, the other for advanced readers, parents and teachers.

Dale Hinshaw is back and floating another of his crackpot ministry schemes-this time, quite literally, with his Salvation Balloons project. Pastor Sam Gardner's wife, Barbara, the 1977 Tenderloin Queen, wins a trip to the Caribbean and thinks she might just go without her workaholic husband. Deena Morrison struggles with being single and alone, while the Friendly Women's Committee strategizes on how they can "help" her. Jimmy Muldock has a secret only his mother knows, though the ever-curious Furnace Committee is bent on discovering it.</p><p>Throughout it all, three things are certain: the Friendly Women's Circle will make more noodles, Dale Hinshaw will push Sam Gardner to the end of his pastoral rope, and the good in human nature will just nudge out the bad.</p><p>Filled with master storyteller Philip Gulley's trademark humor and depth of insight, this wise, joyous novel will delight and satisfy both those who know and love Harmony and those who are just discovering it.</p></p><p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>. Gulley lives with his wife and two sons in Indiana, and is a frequent speaker at churches, colleges, and retreat centers across the country.</p>In his third full-length Harmony novel, Gulley delivers another series of charming vignettes about Quaker pastor Sam Gardner and his eccentric parishioners. In fact, Gulley's underlying thesis seems to be that to live in a small Midwestern town is to be eccentric, as evidenced by such bizarre schemes as Harvey Muldock's attempt to store his beloved convertible in his garage attic, only to have it crash down on top of his wife's car. At its best, Gulley's work is comparable to Gail Godwin's fiction, Garrison Keillor's storytelling and Christopher Guest's filmmaking. When, for example, an obnoxiously pietistic member of the church releases "salvation balloons" in an attempt to save all those Democrats in Chicago, he gets an angry call from a zookeeper in Pittsburgh who reports that the first recipient of one of his balloons was a rare trumpeter swan, who choked on the balloon and died. These moments of sharp wit are interwoven with gentler, more homespun humor in a league with Jan Karon's Mitford series, exemplified in a plot revolving around the only single, attractive, well-educated woman in town and her vain attempts to find love. Sometimes Gulley indulges in hyperbole that reflects just a bit of condescension toward his smalltown characters; for example, he describes Italian night at the local cafe as "Chef Boyardee spaghetti from a can and Bea Majors on the organ." His caricatures of conservative Christians occasionally seem a bit mean-spirited as well. Still, readers who seek pleasant, witty and occasionally poignant fiction will delight in this book.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Brass Ring</h2><p>The Brass Ring: Power, Influence and the Brascan Empire</p><p></p><h2>Big Book of Loom Knitting: Learn to Loom Knit</h2><p>Big Book of Loom Knitting: Learn to Loom Knit Knitting looms are amazingly easy to use, and they&#39;re available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

Irreverent, poetic, and thrillingly evil, these new versions of classic fairy tales are less comic and playful than the fractured fairy-tale picture books for younger readers. In fact, as the editors point out in their introduction, fairy tales were originally told to older audiences before the stories were sweetened and simplified for children. Many of these retellings are contemporary, set in the city and the schoolyard as well as the dark woods, with lots of evil stepmoms and rivalrous siblings. Garth Nix's "Hansel's Eyes" may be too lurid, even for teens, spelling out the fairy tale's elemental terror in graphic detail, with a Hagmom who gets Dad to dump the kids in a city wasteland. But many of the other stories are dark and strange and beautiful. In Gregory Maguire's "The Seven Stage Comeback," the dwarves speak in poetic monologues as they try to get back their beloved Snow White after she's left them for the prince ("We took her in when she was lost / But then we lost her in our turn"). Jane Yolen's "Cinder Elephant" is about "a lovely big girl," whose dancing slippers are size nine-and-a-half wide, very wide; she hooks the prince with her love of sports and books and her fast, funny talk. Both immediate and traditional, this dramatic collection will grab middle-graders and teens for storytelling and readers' theater. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Also lacking distinction are the illustrations. Evocative of Eastern European folk art, the paintings seem stilted, flat, and often garishly over-decorated. Brett's vivid style suited last year's The Twelve Days of Christmas (Dodd, 1986) and Scary, Scary Halloween (Clarion, 1986) by Eve Bunting, but here it seems at odds with this folktale.

She never dreamed of being a writer until she took one college English class. Then she became "hooked on great writing...I didn't know about this part of me until I went to college&#x2014;didn't know that I loved beautiful stories." One night, inspired by the Southern writer, James Agee, she wrote her first picture book, When I Was Young in the Mountains, which was an instant success. Since then, she's written more than 60 children's books and received numerous awards, including the Newbery and the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award. With simplicity and grace, Rylant's books explore such subjects as aging, the trials of spirituality, the loss of a loved one, and the spirit and integrity of family life with all its joys and hardships. Rylant has said, "Books alter our hearts." Her books are a testament to this promise. Rylant lives in the Pacific Northwest. For more information about Cynthia Rylant, visit: scholastic.com/tradebooksGrade 6 Up-Heavenly Village is peopled with souls not quite ready for heaven. Rylant relates the stories of seven of the Village residents in a series of carefully crafted vignettes that seem to convey the essence of a highly personal spiritual understanding. Her selection of characters seems at least in part dictated by the theology she is constructing. Readers meet a doctor who now spends his time doing nothing but talking with his "patients" (who just know they must have died and gone to heaven if a doctor is actually listening to them). The Village Timekeeper (a bank teller on Earth) never had time for beauty. The Village baker, Violet Rose, "had a very sad childhood. This is always something God has little power over. (And because of this, He sometimes has a lot of explaining to do to the new arrival in heaven)." She was killed by a hit-and-run driver. There is a boy named Harold and his dog, Fortune. Fortune just loves to rescue people and was sent to the Village because he kept trying to rescue angels in heaven who didn't need rescuing. Harold went along because the two are inseparable. Oh, and the man who was driving the car that killed Violet Rose is in the Village also. Adult in both tone and sensibility, the book comes up short as a work of fiction for children. They might enjoy the description of Fortune's well-meant attempts to rescue angels, but there is little else to draw them in. Heartfelt and well-intentioned, this offering is ultimately unsatisfying and muddled.<br><i>Elaine Fort Weischedel, Turner Free Library, Randolph, MA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>House Industries Postcard Box</h2><p>This handsome postcard collection features an impressive range of letters, numbers, symbols and patterns from their collection of typographic treasures.

But most began slowly to understand what was unfolding, even when they found it difficult to grasp the breadth of the catastrophe.Among the journalists, William Shirer understood what was happening. Edgar Mowrer, Dorothy Thompson, and Sigrid Schultz, reporters, were alarmed. Consul General George Messersmith distinguished. Truman Smith, the first American official to meet Hitler, was an astute political observer. Historian William Dodd, who FDR tapped as ambassador in Berlin, left disillusioned; his daughter Martha scandalized the embassy with her procession of lovers, Nazis she took up with; she ended as a Soviet spy.On the scene were George Kenn</p><p>Andrew Nagorski served as <i>Newsweek</i>&#x2019;s bureau chief in Hong Kong, Moscow, Rome, Bonn, Warsaw, and Berlin.

Visit him at AndrewNagorski.com.Hitlerland Introduction<p></p> <br>Of all the Americans who reported from Germany between World War I and World War II, no one was quite as well prepared for the assignment as Sigrid Schultz. Born in Chicago in 1893 to parents who had come from Norway, she spent most of her youth, starting at age eight, in Europe. Her father was a successful portrait painter who made Paris his base, which meant Sigrid attended French schools. When he received an assignment to paint the portrait of the king and queen of W�rttemberg, she also attended German schools for several months, equipping her not only with the language but also with early insights into local attitudes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Few foreign painters were invited to German courts in those days and the other little girls tried to be nice,&#x201d; she recalled. &#x201c;But it was clear that to be non-German was a deficiency. Any foreigner who failed to be dazzled and humbled by German Kultur or efficiency was, at best, an object of pity.&#x201d;<br> <br>Schultz studied international law at the Sorbonne and then moved to Berlin with her parents. There, she witnessed World War I from the losing side. Once the United States entered the war in 1917, she and her parents had to report every day to the police as &#x201c;enemy aliens,&#x201d; but she was able to continue her studies, taking courses at Berlin University. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Chicago Tribune hired her to work with its Berlin correspondent Richard Henry Little, who was impressed with her language skills. But from the moment she started her new job in early 1919, she demonstrated her reporting skills as well, teaming up with Little on assignments.<br> <br>Together, Schultz and Little interviewed dozens of German officers to get a sense of their mood in the wake of Germany&#x2019;s defeat. Most were bitter, but none more so than &#x201c;a sour, disagreeable little man in navy blue, whose name was Raeder,&#x201d; Schultz wrote. The German officer told the two reporters: &#x201c;You Americans need not feel proud of yourselves. Within twenty-five years at the latest, your country and my country will be at war again. And this time we shall win, because we will be better prepared than you will be.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Americans didn&#x2019;t take offense&#x2014;quite the contrary. &#x201c;I well remember how, on that day in 1919, we felt sorry for vengeful little Raeder,&#x201d; Schultz noted. &#x201c;He was taking defeat so hard. He was, we felt, simply consuming himself with hatred.&#x201d;<br> <br>Schultz became the Chicago Tribune&#x2019;s chief correspondent for Central Europe in 1926, and she remained based in Berlin until 1941, impressing successive waves of the otherwise almost all-male American press corps with her knowledge of Germany and her tenaciousness in chasing down stories. Looking back at her experiences in her book Germany Will Try It Again, written and published during World War II, she argued that Raeder&#x2019;s bitterness was widely shared by his countrymen, along with his eagerness to avenge their defeat in the previous global conflagration.<br> <br>By that point, of course, she knew where this bitterness had led, and the question arises whether some of her descriptions were colored by hindsight. But in the case of her recollection of the interview with Raeder, it appears that she only added a final flourish to emphasize the accuracy of his prediction: &#x201c;When, almost twenty-two years later, Adolf Hitler declared war on the United States, the man commanding the German Navy was Grand Admiral Dr. Erich Raeder.&#x201d;<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Much has been written about Americans in France and Great Britain during the interwar period, and even a fair amount about Americans in the Soviet Union. But, for a variety of reasons, the Americans who lived, worked or traveled in Germany at the time when Hitler was coming to power and then forged the Third Reich haven&#x2019;t attracted anything like that level of attention&#x2014;including Schultz and many of her colleagues. In fact, they are often forgotten. Or, like diplomat George Kennan, they may be remembered, but not for their German experiences; the German chapter in their lives was eclipsed by other parts of their biographies that made them famous&#x2014;in Kennan&#x2019;s case, as the architect of the containment policy that successive postwar presidents pursued in dealing with the Soviet Union.<br> <br>As a result, Americans often have the impression that the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the subsequent rush to terror and war took place in a strange, isolated country. Few of them pause to ask who were the Americans there who witnessed these events firsthand, how they perceived and reported them either as part of their jobs or simply as curious visitors, and what kind of impact their accounts had on their countrymen&#x2019;s views of Germany at the time.<br> <br>Today, it&#x2019;s conventional wisdom that Hitler&#x2019;s intentions were perfectly clear from the outset and that his policies could only result in World War II and the Holocaust. Most people find it hard to imagine that in the 1920s and right through the 1930s, American reporters, diplomats, entertainers, sociologists, students and others living in or passing through Germany wouldn&#x2019;t have all instantly seen and understood what was happening before their eyes. After all, they had ringside seats, providing them with an unparalleled view of the most dramatic story of the twentieth century. Several of them not only observed Hitler from afar, but met and spoke to him, both when he was still a local agitator in Munich and then the all-powerful dictator in Berlin. To them, he wasn&#x2019;t some abstract embodiment of evil but a real-life politician. Some Americans tried to take his measure very early, while others did so once he was in power. And even those who didn&#x2019;t have those opportunities witnessed the consequences of his actions.<br> <br>Yet their readings of what was happening in Germany, and what Hitler represented, varied greatly. There were those who met Hitler and recognized he represented almost a primeval force and possessed an uncanny ability to tap into the emotions and anger of the German people, and those who dismissed him as a clownish figure who would vanish from the political scene as quickly as he had appeared. There were those who, at least initially, viewed him and his movement sympathetically or even embraced it, and those whose instinctive misgivings quickly gave way to full-scale alarm, recognizing that he was a threat not only to Germany but also to the world.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t just Americans who didn&#x2019;t know what to make of Hitler or who hadn&#x2019;t really examined what passed for his worldview. Otto Strasser, an early follower of Hitler who later broke with him and escaped from Germany, recalled a dinner with several top Nazi officials at the 1927 Party Congress in Nuremberg. When it became apparent no one had read Hitler&#x2019;s autobiographical screed Mein Kampf in its entirety, they agreed that they would ask anyone who joined them if he had done so&#x2014;and stick that person with the bill. &#x201c;Nobody had read Mein Kampf, so everyone had to pay his own bill,&#x201d; Strasser reported.<br> <br>The unfolding of history only looks inevitable in retrospect, and the judgments of the Americans who were witnessing these events unfold were based on a variety of factors: their predispositions, the different slices of reality that they observed and whether at times they saw only what they wanted to see, whatever the signals to the contrary. Schultz chose to highlight Raeder&#x2019;s comments in 1919 to bolster her thesis later, once the United States and Germany were at war again, that Hitler&#x2019;s movement was the logical outcome of the hate fomented by the country&#x2019;s defeat in the previous war. But other Americans dwelled on their warm reception in the aftermath of World War I, and wanted to believe that the toll of that conflict had been so high that it had served as a decisive object lesson. Edgar Ansel Mowrer, the Berlin correspondent for the rival Chicago paper, the Daily News, recalled that in the 1920s &#x201c;most Americans in Germany nourished a legitimate hope that Germany&#x2019;s defeat, humiliation, inflation and internal disorders had brought home to most citizens the folly of again seeking European hegemony.&#x201d;<br> <br>While correspondents like Schultz and Mowrer, and diplomats like Kennan and several of his colleagues, were hardly innocents abroad&#x2014;they had studied and worked elsewhere in Europe&#x2014;many of the Americans who were in Germany in this period were both very young and very inexperienced. This, of course, colored their perceptions and influenced their reactions. They were alternately charmed, shocked and mesmerized by Germany&#x2019;s combination of old world rigidity and new, postwar world extremism, whether in political or sexual behavior.<br> <br>As a result of their country&#x2019;s peculiar role, Americans in Germany were in a special position. Although the United States had joined in the fighting in World War I, it was only in its later stages. Most Americans were far from eager to be dragged into a new European conflict, which accounted for the strength of isolationist sentiments back home. Americans in Germany were put in a different category than the other winners of World War I: they were seen as almost neutral, far less vengeful than the French, in particular, and, in general, more willing to give the defeated Germans the benefit of the doubt. As observers, they could stand a bit outside and above the continental rivalries.<br> <br>Like Americans everywhere, they also tended to live a privileged existence, observing the material deprivations and growing violence but usually sheltered from them personally. They socialized extensively with each other, celebrated Thanksgiving and other holidays, and enjoyed the trappings of the expat lifestyle while monitoring the bigger events that swirled all around them. Louis Lochner, who reported for the Associated Press throughout this period, made casual mention of life in &#x201c;the American colony,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;enviable camaraderie&#x201d; among the American correspondents, &#x201c;even among those who are one anothers&#x2019; [sic] fiercest competitors.&#x201d;<br> <br>To be sure, tensions erupted between those who came to radically differing views of Hitler and the Nazis, and what their military buildup signified. Then, too, there were the personal jealousies and resentments. The American Embassy in Berlin was a much leaner outpost than embassies are nowadays, and the small, overworked staffs and their spouses were often feuding about both their political views and petty grievances. There also were fissures between the politically appointed ambassadors and the professional foreign service staffers and military attach�s. Throw in the perceived scandalous behavior of an ambassador&#x2019;s daughter and you have a recipe for real drama. All of this could happen in any diplomatic outpost, but in Berlin it was magnified by the unrelenting tensions that accompanied Hitler&#x2019;s reign.<br> <br>The American correspondents, by contrast, were far more numerous than they are today&#x2014;reaching a peak of about fifty in Berlin in the mid-1930s. Those were the days when wire services, newspaper chains and dailies from a wide array of American cities across the country, not just from New York and Washington, fielded correspondents overseas, giving them remarkable free rein to pursue their stories. And radio broadcasters soon joined that mix.<br> <br>As a Newsweek foreign correspondent in the 1980s and 1990s, I felt I was living in what, especially from the perspective of today&#x2019;s cutbacks in the media business, looks like the golden era of journalism. But my predecessors in Berlin lived far more largely. Mowrer, for instance, set up a new office for the Chicago Daily News right above the &#x201c;Kranzler Corner,&#x201d; a famous caf� at the prestigious downtown intersection of Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden. It boasted a second-floor reception center for American visitors, who could come by to chat, read American newspapers and even dictate to the office secretary on occasion. This was more than a news bureau; it was almost a small diplomatic mission.<br> <br>There were plenty of Americans, including several who bore household names, who dropped in to see what this new Germany was all about&#x2014;the likes of writers Thomas Wolfe and Sinclair Lewis, architect Philip Johnson, broadcaster Edward R. Murrow, former President Herbert Hoover, the black sociologist and historian W. E. B. DuBois and, of course, aviator Charles Lindbergh. Somewhat surprisingly, it was no great feat for Americans and other foreigners to enter and explore this curious, darkening world. &#x201c;One thing one forgets is how easy it was to travel around Germany then,&#x201d; recalls historian Robert Conquest, who traveled all over Europe in 1938 with some fellow Oxford University students and dropped in on Germany as well. &#x201c;It was far easier than in postwar communist countries.&#x201d;<br> <br>I always have been drawn to this period of history, seeking to understand how Hitler and his followers could have gained total control of Germany as quickly as they did, with all the ensuing devastating consequences. This had a direct impact on my family&#x2019;s history as it did on millions of others&#x2019;. My parents grew up in Poland, and my father fought in the Polish Army before escaping to the West to join up with Polish forces under British command. After the war, I was born in Edinburgh. My parents then sailed for the United States, where they started a new life as political refugees. That&#x2019;s why I grew up as an American instead of a Pole.<br> <br>As a foreign correspondent who did two tours in Germany&#x2014;the first one in Bonn during the last years of the Cold War, and the second in Berlin in the late 1990s&#x2014;I often wrote about how Germans dealt with the legacy of the Nazi past. But I have to admit I knew very little about the Americans who worked in Berlin in those dramatic times. There were exceptions, of course. My colleagues and I all knew about William Shirer, the author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, and that the Adlon Hotel, which was rebuilt and reopened after German unification, had been the hangout for Shirer, Dorothy Thompson and other star journalists of the time. But I can&#x2019;t say I had delved much into their personal histories.<br> <br>When I began to do so for this book, I realized there was a rich vein of stories that not only provided insights into what it was like to work or travel in Germany in the midst of these seismic events but also offered a unique perspective on them. Through their experiences, I felt I was reliving this heavily dissected era with an intensity and immediacy that is often lacking elsewhere. Whenever possible, I drew on firsthand accounts&#x2014;whether in memoirs, notes, correspondence or interviews with the occasional still living witness&#x2014;to share that perspective with readers.<br> <br>Some of these tales were published but long forgotten, while I found others in unpublished manuscripts and letters in various archives and libraries, or sometimes provided by the children of the authors. In the case of the young diplomat Jacob Beam, for example, who served in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin in the second half of the 1930s, his son Alex&#x2014;a good friend from my Moscow days, when we both were stationed there as correspondents&#x2014;provided me with a copy of his unpublished manuscript. Some of the most colorful details about life in Germany came from the unpublished writings of Katharine (Kay) Smith, the wife of Captain Truman Smith, who was still a junior military attach� when he became the first American official to meet Hitler.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s important to keep in mind that this is history as seen by eyewitnesses without the benefit of knowing where these events would lead. The Wannsee Conference that formalized elaborate plans for the Holocaust was still off in the future&#x2014;January 20, 1942, to be exact. The German Army was only beginning to encounter its first...</p><h2>McDuff Moves In</h2><p>A little gray dog that nobody seems to want finds just the right home--and a name.</p><p>A little white dog that nobody wants tumbles off the dogcatcher's truck and into the home of Lucy and Fred in a story from Wells (Bunny Cakes, p. 67, etc.) that recalls a time when compassion wasn't in such short supply. After his fall from the truck, the little white dog goes from house to house, barking at doors and garnering chilly responses from growling dogs and hissing cats. A young couple in pajamas, robes, and slippers, rousted from their beds, invite the bedraggled dog into their home to feed and bathe, and then set out for the pound. Before they've gone far, they admit to each other that they don't want to take the dog back. A late-night feast of McDuff's Melt In Your Mouth Shortbread Biscuits gives the dog his new name: McDuff. Cars, appliances, and textile prints set this several decades ago; Jeffers works in a painterly style that complements the unadorned text: ``He needed something to eat. He needed a warm place to sleep. So he went looking.'' In atmosphere and outlook, this book--the first in a series--is a kindred spirit of Marjorie Flack's Angus stories from the 1940s.

At the first house, another dog barks at him. At the second, a cat hisses. But at the third house, a young couple invite him in to share their sausages and rice pudding and to have a bath. Though they start to drive him to the pound, they change their minds and take him back home to stay. The paintings create a 1930s setting full of innocence and charm<i>was</i> there a time and place when people would set out for the dog pound at night wearing their pajamas and robes? Perhaps only the book's dreamlike quality could make this seem natural. With the many night scenes, the illustrations use a rather muted palette and simple lines, which contributes to the book's quiet tone. This collaboration by Wells and Jeffers is as sweet, substantial, and comforting as that bowl of rice pudding and will suit the many children who like stories with simple words, clear story lines, and happily-ever-after endings. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>The Curious George Library</h2><p>The Curious George Library</p><p>Brought to life by Margaret and H.A. Rey, Curious George has found a lasting place in the hearts of millions of young readers worldwide. Readers of Spanish will be entertained by the engaging exploits of the Popular Monkey in Jorge El Curioso, the Spanish translation of Curious George.<p>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. Hans Augusto Rey (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, Margret (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian.

Most of those errors in judgment are easily forgotten, but some of them are too enormous, too devastating to ever fully disappear from memory. The mistake I made when I was twelve still haunted me at fifty-three. Most of the time, I didn't think about it, but there were days when something happened that brought it all back to me in a rush, that filled me with the guilt of a twelve-year-old who had known better and that made me wish I could return to the summer of 1962 and live it over again. The Monday Abby Chapman Worley showed up at my front door was one of those days.</p> <p>I was having a productive day as I worked on<i> The Broad Street Murders,</i> the thirty-third novel in my Granny Fran series. If I had known how successful that series would become, I would have made Fran Gallagher younger at the start. She was already seventy in the first book. Now, thirteen years later, she was eighty-three and going strong, but I wondered how long I could keep her tracking down killers.</p> <p>The house was blissfully quiet. My daughter Shannon, who'd graduated from Westfield High School the Saturday before, was giving cello lessons in a music store downtown. The June air outside my sunroom window was clear and still, and because my house was set on a curve in the road, I had an expansive view of my New Jersey neighborhood with its vibrant green lawns and manicured gardens. I would type a sentence or two, then stare out the window, enjoying the scenery as I thought about what might happen next in my story.</p> <p>I'd finished Chapter Three and was just beginning Chapter Four when my doorbell rang. I leaned back in my chair, trying to decide whether to answer it or not. It was probably a friend of Shannon's, but what if it was a courier, delivering a contract or something else that might require my signature?</p> <p>I peered out the front window. No trucks in sight. A white Volkswagen Beetle&#x2014;a convertible with its top down&#x2014;was parked in front of my house, however, and since my concentration was already broken, I decided I might as well see who it was.</p> <p>I walked through the living room and opened the door and my heart sank a little. The slender young woman standing on the other side of my screen door looked too old to be a friend of Shannon's, and I worried that she might be one of my fans. Although I tried to protect my identity as much as possible, some of my most determined readers had found me over the years. I adored them and was grateful for their loyalty to my books, but I also treasured my privacy, especially when I was deep into my work. "Yes?" I smiled.</p> <p>The woman's sunny-blond hair was cut short, barely brushing the tops of her ears and she was wearing very dark sunglasses that made it difficult to see her eyes. There was a pretty sophistication about her.Her shorts were clean and creased,her mauve T-shirt tucked in with a belt. A small navy-blue pocketbook was slung over one shoulder.</p> <p>"Mrs. Bauer?" she asked, confirming my suspicion. Julianne Bauer, my maiden name, was also my pseudonym. Friends and neighbors knew me as Julie Sellers.</p> <p>"Yes?" I said.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to just show up like this." She slipped her hands into her pockets. "My name is Abby Worley.You and my father&#x2014;Ethan Chapman&#x2014;were friends when you were kids."</p> <p>My hand flew to my mouth. I hadn't heard Ethan's name since the summer of 1962&#x2014;forty-one years earlier&#x2014;yet it took me less than a second to place him. In my memory, I was transported back to Bay Head Shores, where my family's bungalow stood next to the Chapmans' and where the life-altering events of that summer erased all the good summers that had preceded it.</p> <p>"You remember him?" Abby Worley asked.</p> <p>"Yes, of course," I said. I pictured Ethan the way he was when I last saw him&#x2014;a skinny, freckled, bespectacled twelve-year-old, a fragile-looking boy with red hair and pale legs. I saw him reeling in a giant blowfish from the canal behind our houses, then rubbing the fish's white belly to make it puff up. I saw him jumping off the bulkhead, wings made from old sheets attached to his arms as he attempted to fly. We had at one time been friends, but not in 1962. The last time I saw him, I beat him up. "I hope you'll forgive me for just showing up like this," she said. "Dad once told me you lived in Westfield, so I asked around. The bagel store. The guy at the video-rental place.Your neighbors are not very good at guarding your privacy. And this is the sort of the thing I didn't want to write in a letter or talk about on the phone."</p> <p>"What sort of thing?" I asked. The serious tone of her voice told me this was more than a visit from a fan.</p> <p>She glanced toward the wicker rockers on my broad front porch.</p> <p>"Could we sit down?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course," I said, pushing open the screen door and walking with her toward the rockers. "Can I get you something to drink?"</p> <p>"No, I'm fine," she said, as she settled into one of the chairs.</p> <p>"This is nice, having a front porch."</p> <p>I nodded. "Once the mosquitoes are here in full force, we don't get much use out of it, but yes, it's nice right now." I studied her, looking for some trace of Ethan in her face. Her cheekbones were high and her deep tan looked stunning on her, regardless of the health implications. Maybe it was fake. She looked like the type of woman who took good care of herself. It was hard for me to picture Ethan as her father. He hadn't been homely, but nerdishness had invaded every cell of his body.</p> <p>"So," I said,"what is it that you didn't want to talk about over the phone?"</p> <p>Now that we were in the shade, she slipped off her sunglasses to reveal blue eyes. "Do you remember my uncle Ned?" she asked.</p> <p>I remembered Ethan's brother even better than I remembered Ethan. I'd had a crush on him, although he'd been six years older than me and quite out of my league. By the end of that summer, though, I'd despised him.</p> <p>I nodded. "Sure," I said. "Well, he died a couple of weeks ago."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that," I said mechanically. "He must have been&#x2014;" I did the math in my head "&#x2014;around fifty-nine?"</p> <p>"He died the night before his fifty-ninth birthday," Abby said.</p> <p>"Had he been ill?"</p> <p>"He had cirrhosis of the liver," Abby said, matter-of-factly.</p> <p>"He drank too much. My father said he...that he started drinking right after the summer your...you know." For the first time, she seemed a little unsure of herself. "Right after your sister died," she said. "He got really depressed. I only knew him as a sad sort of person."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said again. I couldn't picture handsome, athletic Ned Chapman as a beaten-down, fifty-nine-year-old man, but then we'd all changed after that summer.</p> <p>"Dad doesn't know I've come to see you," Abby said. "And he wouldn't be happy about it, but I just had to."</p> <p>I leaned forward, wishing she would get to the point. "Why are you here, Abby?" I asked.</p> <p>She nodded as if readying herself to say something she'd rehearsed. "Dad and I cleaned out Uncle Ned's town house," she said. "I was going through his kitchen and I found an envelope in one of the drawers addressed to the Point Pleasant Police Department. Dad opened it and..." She reached into her pocketbook and handed me a sheet of paper. "This is just a copy."</p> <p>I looked down at the short, typed missive, dated two months earlier.</p> <p>To Whom it May Concern: I have information about a murder that occurred in your jurisdiction in 1962. The wrong person paid for that crime. I'm terminally ill and want to set the record straight. I can be contacted at the above phone number. Sincerely, Ned Chapman</p> <p>"My God." I leaned against the back of the rocker and closed my eyes. I thought my head might explode with the meaning behind the words. "He was going to confess," I said.</p> <p>"We don't know that," Abby said quickly. "I mean, Dad is absolutely sure Uncle Ned didn't do it. I mean, he is <i>completely </i>sure. But he'd told me about you long ago. My mom and I have read all your books, and so of course he told me everything about you. He said how you suspected that Uncle Ned did it, even though no one else did, so I thought you had a right to know about the letter. I told Dad we should take it to the police. I mean, it sounds like the guy who was sent to prison might not have done it."</p> <p>"Absolutely," I agreed, holding the letter in the air. "The police need to see this."</p> <p>Abby bit her lip."The only thing is, Dad doesn't want to take it to them. He said that the man who was convicted died in prison, so it doesn't really matter now."</p> <p>I felt tears spring to my eyes. I knew that George Lewis had died of pneumonia five years into serving his life sentence for my sister's murder. I'd always believed that he'd been wrongly imprisoned. How cruel and unfair.</p> <p>"At the very least, his name should be cleared," I said firmly.</p> <p>"I think so, too," Abby agreed. "But Dad is afraid that the police will jump to the conclusion that Uncle Ned did it, just like you did. My uncle was screwed up, but he could never hurt anyone."</p> <p>I pulled a tissue from my shorts' pocket and removed my glasses to blot the tears from my eyes."Maybe he <i>did</i> hurt someone," I suggested gently, slipping my glasses on again. "And maybe <i>that's</i> what screwed him up."</p> <p>Abby shook her head."I know it looks that way, but Dad said Ned had an airtight alibi. That he was home when your sis&#x2014;when it happened."</p> <p>"It sounds like your father wants to protect his brother no matter what," I said, trying not to sound as bitter as I felt.</p> <p>"If your father won't take this to the police," I said, "I will." I didn't mean it to sound like a threat, but it probably did.</p> <p>"I understand," Abby said. "And I agree the police need to know. But Dad..." She shook her head. "Would you consider talking to him?" she asked.</p> <p>I thought of how unwelcome that conversation would be to Ethan. "It doesn't sound like he wants to talk about it," I said. "And you said he'd be angry that you came here."</p> <p>"He won't be angry," Abby said. "He never really gets angry. He'll just be...upset. I'll tell him I came. But then, if you could call him, maybe you could persuade him.You have the biggest personal stake in this."</p> <p>She didn't understand how the thought of revisiting the summer of 1962 made my palms sweat and my stomach burn. I thought about George Lewis's sister, Wanda, and the personal stake <i>she</i> would have in this. I thought about his cousin Salena, the woman who'd raised him. Nothing would return my sister to her family or George Lewis to his, but at the very least, we all deserved to know the truth. "Give me his number," I said.</p> <p>She took the letter from me, wrote Ethan's number on a corner of it and handed it back. Slipping her sunglasses on again, she stood up.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, returning her pen to her tiny pocketbook. She looked at me. "I hope...well, I don't know what to hope, actually. I guess I just hope the truth finally comes out."</p> <p>"I hope so, too, Abby," I said. I watched her walk down the sidewalk and get into the white Beetle convertible. She waved as she pulled away from the curb and I watched her drive up my street, then turn the corner and disappear.</p> <p>I sat there a long time, perfectly still, the letter and all its horrible implications lying on my lap. Chapter Four was forgotten. My body felt leaden and my heart ached, because I knew that no matter who turned out to have murdered my sister, the responsibility for her death would always rest with me.</p></p><h2>Gakuen Alice Volume 3</h2><p>Mikan joins her best friend, Hotaru, at the Alice Academy, a special school for people with an &#34;Alice,&#34; or paranormal talent, and she must learn to know and use her own such talent if she hopes to stay.</p><p></p><h2>Batman: Shadow of the Bat Vol. 1</h2><p>Batman isn&#x2019;t the only masked crusader in town&#x2014;and Arkham Asylum has many, many cells beyond those detaining the Penguin, the Joker, and Poison Ivy. <br><br> But this is not the dark, dismal Arkham Asylum of old&#x2014;this modern Arkham is run by the son of the original founder, Jeremiah Arkham.

Displays of this impulse include world's fairs, fraternal organizations, and films such as <i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Shari M. Huhndorf uses cultural artifacts such as these to examine the phenomenon of "going native," showing its complex relations to social crises in the broader American society&#x2015;including those posed by the rise of industrial capitalism, the completion of the military conquest of Native America, and feminist and civil rights activism.</p><p>Huhndorf looks at several modern cultural manifestations of the desire of European Americans to emulate Native Americans. Some are quite pervasive, as is clear from the continuing, if controversial, existence of fraternal organizations for young and old which rely upon "Indian" costumes and rituals. Another fascinating example is the process by which Arctic travelers "went Eskimo," as Huhndorf describes in her readings of Robert Flaherty's travel narrative <i>My Eskimo Friends</i> and his documentary film <i>Nanook of the North</i>. Huhndorf asserts that European Americans' appropriation of Native identities is not a thing of the past, and she takes a skeptical look at the "tribes" beloved of New Age devotees.</p><p><i>Going Native</i> shows how even seemingly harmless images of Native Americans can articulate and reinforce a range of power relations including slavery, patriarchy, and the continued oppression of Native Americans. Huhndorf reconsiders the cultural importance and political implications of the history of the impersonation of Indian identity in light of continuing debates over race, gender, and colonialism in American culture.</p></p><p><p>Shari M. Huhndorf is Associate Professor of English and Director of the Ethnic Studies Program at the University of Oregon.</p><p>"For teachers, <i>Going Native</i> provides a wealth of examples we might bring into the classroom, as well as a critique of identity politics that students will find interesting.... As a Native person working in academia, I am heartened by an inquiry that uses white representations of nonwhite peoples to examine European American identity and insists on applying identity theory to the dominant culture."</p> (Katy Gray Brown <i>Hypatia</i>)<br><br><p>"Teaching American Indian history, more than other courses, demands attention to the politics of representation. Non-native students are likely to be completely unfamiliar with the historical material presented to them and, at the same time, to feel an ownership and strong attachment to particular images of Indians. As Shari M. Huhndorf argues in <i>Going Native</i>, the racial dynamics of conquest, encoded into popular culture, are still very much central to non-native American identity. For this compelling reason, this book is a useful and imaginative addition to the literature on Indian-white relations."</p> (<i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br><p>"The book's central focus is the eradication of an old, and the birth of a new, nation. It is about the origins and significance of manifest destiny&#x2015;perhaps the most original analysis of that process I have seen.... This is a fascinating book and the opening quotation by Vine Deloria on how Indians haunt the collective unconscious of the white man sets the tone for a lively read.... It is an important contribution to the literature on a topic that deserves much more public debate."</p> (<i>Cultural Survival Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>"Huhndorf's shrewd analysis goes beyond simply identifying and then castigating those European Americans who have disregarded the repercussions of their cultural appropriation. The result is that <i>Going Native</i> persuasively demonstrates how such acts can be much more revealing of their historical moment then they at first might seem."</p> (<i>American Literature</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Going Native</i> will be graciously welcomed into American Indian Studies and the study of colonialism/imperialism. Huhndorf's detailed research and methodology are important contributions to American Indian Studies because they allow for the examination of cultural texts and social positions of power without having to resort to arguments of what is authentic and non-authentic Indian culture."</p> (<i>H-Net Reviews</i>)</p><h2>How to Knit a Murder (Seaside Knitters Society)</h2><p><b>* Includes a knitting pattern *</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>A mysterious woman arrives in picturesque Sea Harbor, Massachusetts, and the Seaside Knitters welcome her into their cozy world of intricate patterns and colorful skeins.

Demarest presents their exploits in an oversized, brightly illustrated format, twin to his <i>Hotshots</i>! (S &amp; S, 2003). A brief, dynamic text follows a typical flight into a burgeoning tempest, beginning with a view of a tranquil beach and ending with a completed mission. The contrast between sunlit and storm-ravaged seas is clear, as are the heavy preparations on shore and the destructive force of the squall as it crosses land. The simple language is reinforced by the vigorous pastels, which open a window into the WC-130 Hercules and the activities of the crew. An extended author's note provides extra data. Team this crisp, exciting book with Franklyn Branley's <i>Hurricane Watch</i> (HarperCollins, 1985) and/or Rick Thomas's <i>Eye of the Storm</i> (Picture Window, 2005) for more meteorology, or pair it with Keith Elliot Greenberg's more demanding <i>Storm Chaser</i> (Blackbirch, 1997) for a personal look at a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) pilot and his experiences.<i>&#x2013;Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.</p><p>The Battle of Iwo Jima, fought in the winter of 1945 on a rocky island south of Japan, brought a ferocious slice of hell to earth: in a month's time, more than 22,000 Japanese soldiers would die defending a patch of ground a third the size of Manhattan, while nearly 26,000 Americans fell taking it from them. The battle was a turning point in the war in the Pacific, and it produced one of World War II's enduring images: a photograph of six soldiers raising an American flag on the flank of Mount Suribachi, the island's commanding high point.<p> One of those young Americans was John Bradley, a Navy corpsman who a few days before had braved enemy mortar and machine-gun fire to administer first aid to a wounded Marine and then drag him to safety. For this act of heroism Bradley would receive the Navy Cross, an award second only to the Medal of Honor.</p><p> Bradley, who died in 1994, never mentioned his feat to his family. Only after his death did Bradley's son James begin to piece together the facts of his father's heroism, which was but one of countless acts of sacrifice made by the young men who fought at Iwo Jima. <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i> recounts the sometimes tragic life stories of the six men who raised the flag that February day--one an Arizona Indian who would die following an alcohol-soaked brawl, another a Kentucky hillbilly, still another a Pennsylvania steel-mill worker--and who became reluctant heroes in the bargain. A strongly felt and well-written entry in a spate of recent books on World War II, <i>Flags</i> gives a you-are-there depiction of that conflict's horrible arenas--and a moving homage to the men whom fate brought there. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima.

(European Classics)</h2><p>A classic of Soviet realism, <i>Time, Forward! </i>captures the enthusiasm and optimism of the first Five-Year Plan in its portrayal of the construction of Magnitogorsk, an enormous metallurgical plant considered one of the finest industrial achievements of the period. It embodies the beliefs of the era--that the collective (here a multinational brigade) through its determination and the application of technology can accomplish the impossible, conquer nature, even overcome time. Utilizing cinematic technique to tell his story, Kataev focuses on a twenty-four hour period when of the Magnitogorsk shock-brigades breaks a world record for pouring cement.

Kataev is credited with suggesting the idea for the Twelve Chairs to his brother Yevgeni Petrov and Ilya Ilf. In return, Kataev insisted that the novel be dedicated to him, in all editions and translations.

That's a long time for a publishing association. Years before I became Mary's editor on the Emma Lord/Alpine series for Ballantine, I was an editorial assistant at another trade house -- and that's where we met, long distance. She lives in Seattle; I live in New York; even eighteen year ago, the phone lines stretched in both directions. At the time Mary was writing successful historical romances for my then-boss, a senior editor. One day Mary and I revealed our unbridled passion for reading crime fiction. Little did I dream then that, soon after I arrived at Ballantine, Mary would become a crime writer herself. Of course, now she's a nationally renowned one . . . and I especially treasure her novels about Emma Lord, the editor-publisher of a small-town weekly newspaper in fictional (but based on fact) Alpine, Washington. The paper is called The Alpine Advocate, which is also the title of the first novel in the series. For any readers who haven't visited Alpine, I heartily recommend starting with Book One -- and then continuing forward (in alphabetical order) to THE ALPINE BETRAYAL, THE ALPINE CHRISTMAS, THE ALPINE DECOY, THE ALPINE ESCAPE, THE ALPINE FURY, THE ALPINE GAMBLE, THE ALPINE HERO, THE ALPINE ICON, THE ALPINE JOURNEY, and (coming soon) THE ALPINE KINDRED.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher<b>Mary Richardson Daheim</b>&nbsp;started spinning stories before she could spell. Daheim has been a journalist, an editor, a public relations consultant, and a freelance writer, but fiction was always her medium of choice. In 1982, she launched a career that is now distinguished by more than sixty novels. In 2000, she won the Literary Achievement Award from the Pacific Northwest Writers Association. In October 2008, she was inducted into the University of Washington&#x2019;s Communication Alumni Hall of Fame. Daheim lives in her hometown of Seattle and is a direct descendant of former residents of the real Alpine, which existed as a logging town from 1910 to 1929, when it was abandoned after the mill was closed. The Alpine/Emma Lord series has created interest in the site, which was named a Washington State ghost town in July 2011. An organization called the Alpine Advocates has been formed to preserve what remains of the town as a historic site.</p><h2>Hiroshima</h2><p>120p paperback, journalist&#39;s account of the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima by American forces, &#39;an epitaph to those who died in one of history&#39;s most catastrophic events&#39;, very good, but it will make you sick</p><p>When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, few could have anticipated its potential for devastation. Pulitzer prize-winning author John Hersey recorded the stories of Hiroshima residents shortly after the explosion and, in 1946, <i>Hiroshima</i> was published, giving the world first-hand accounts from people who had survived it. The words of Miss Sasaki, Dr. Fujii, Mrs. Nakamara, Father Kleinsorg, Dr. Sasaki, and the Reverend Tanimoto gave a face to the statistics that saturated the media and solicited an overwhelming public response. Whether you believe the bomb made the difference in the war or that it should never have been dropped, "Hiroshima" is a must read for all of us who live in the shadow of armed conflict.4 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>US/BNA 2019 Postage Stamp Catalog (US BNA Postage Stamp Catalog)</h2><p>More than 400 full-color, spiral-bound pages<p> Thousands of colorful stamp images throughout �� Hardbound with hidden spiral</p><p> �� Information for every stamp collector from novice to expert</p><p> �� All popular formats: singles, plate blocks, line pairs, booklet panes, first day covers, postal stationary, and more</p><p> �� Illustrated Stamp Identifier: describes and pictures the identifying features that enable the collector to</p><p> distinguish among common and rare look-alike stamps</p><p> �� Collector's Guide: explains and describes design varieties, production methods, collecting formats,</p><p> quality and condition criteria, and postal markings</p><p> Published since 1935, the H.E.

Now, author Jeffrey Melnick reveals just how much the Family creepy crawled their way through Los Angeles in the sixties and then on through American social, political, and cultural life for close to fifty years, firmly lodging themselves in our minds. Even now, it is almost impossible to discuss the sixties, teenage runaways, sexuality, drugs, music, California, and even the concept of family without referencing Manson and his "girls." <br><br> Not just another history of Charles Manson, <i>Creepy Crawling</i> explores how the Family weren't so much outsiders but emblematic of the Los Angeles counterculture freak scene, and how Manson worked to connect himself to the mainstream of the time. Ever since they spent two nights killing seven residents of Los Angeles&#x2014;what we now know as the "Tate-LaBianca murders"&#x2014;the Manson family has rarely slipped from the American radar for long. From Emma Cline's <i>The Girls</i> to the recent TV show <i>Aquarius</i>, the family continues to find an audience. What is it about Charles Manson and his family that captivates us still? Author Jeffrey Melnick sets out to answer this question in this fascinating and compulsively readable cultural history of the Family and their influence from 1969 to the present.</p><p>Jeffrey Melnick has been thinking about the Manson Family since first encountering the book and mini-series <i>Helter Skelter</i> in the 1970s. Melnick is a professor at University of Massachusetts Boston and the author of <i>9/11 Culture: America Under Construction</i> (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), <i>Black-Jewish Relations on Trial</i> (University Press of Mississippi, 2000), and <i>A Right to Sing the Blues</i> (Harvard University Press, 1999). He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Jeff Melnick has been teaching and writing about American cultural history for some 25 years. His books on Black-Jewish relations, 9/11, immigration, and popular culture have been widely reviewed and cited often in academic journals and mainstream journalism. His first book, A Right to Sing the Blues: African Americans, Jews, and American Popular Song was given a Booklist Editor&#39;s Choice Award for 1999 and his most recent book, 9/11 Culture: American Under Construction was translated into Arabic soon after its initial publication.

Of the lectures that can be fully reconstructed, those of 1827 are the clearest, the maturest in form, and the most accessible to nonspecialists. In them, readers will find Hegel engaged in lively debates and in important refinements of his treatment of the concept of religion, the Oriental religions and Judaism, Christology, the Trinity, the God-world relationship, and many other topics.<br><br>This edition contains a new editorial introduction as well as critical annotations on the text and tables, bibliography, and glossary from the complete edition. The result of an international collaborative effort on the part of Walter Jaeschke, Ricardo Ferrara, and Peter C. Hodgson, the new edition is appearing simultaneously in German, English, and Spanish. The English edition has been prepared by a team consisting of Robert F. Brown (University of Delaware), Peter C. Hodgson (Vanderbilt University), and J. Michael Stewart (Farnham, England), with the assistance of H. S. Harris (York University).</p><p>&#34;In this definitive English edition we now at last possess an adequate tool for scholarly work on Hegel&#39;s philosophy of religion. The translation, accurate and yet readable, is bound to last more than a lifetime. The introductions provide us with up-to-date information on scholarship and with the best available guide to Hegel&#39;s own thought. This edition clearly constitutes the most significant achievement in Hegel scholarship in America in years.&#34; (Louis Dupr, Yale University)Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Georgia O&#39;Keeffe at Ghost Ranch: A Photo-Essay</h2><p>The American artist Georgia O'Keeffe had been living alone on the Ghost Ranch in New Mexico for seventeen years when photographer John Loengard, on assignment for Life magazine, visited her there in 1966. Even in that vast, windswept landscape, O'Keeffe's was an imposing presence. Adamant about her privacy and about the parts of her life she consented to have photographed, O'Keeffe, then eighty years old, proved a challenging but rewarding subject.<br>Striking in their simplicity and bold composition, the fifty photographs in this classic volume - arranged in sequence from sunrise to sunset - record a day in the life not of a renowned painter, but of a woman living alone in a lonely setting. Yet the pictures offer a clear connection between the austere poetry of the landscape and O'Keeffe's own self-created outer and inner worlds, her artistic imagination being filtered by the bleached bones and infinite emptiness of the desert, which, as she said herself, "knows no kindness with all its beauty". Accompanied by some of O'Keeffe's reflections on life in the desert, and by the photographer's illuminating recollections of the three-day shoot, this volume, reprinted in an attractive format, is a stunning example of the important dynamic that exists between photographer and subject, and remains one of the most stirring photographic essays ever created of an American artist.</p><p>The vast landscape of New Mexico won the heart of American artist Georgia O'Keeffe on her first visit there in 1917, and the open sky, parched earth, and bleached white bones she found there soon became the prominent subjects of her paintings. She granted John Loengard, a photographer for <i>Life</i> magazine, the rare opportunity to photograph her in her home at Ghost Ranch in 1966. Fifty of the black-and-white photographs he took that day fill this 79-page, small-format hardcover and form a classic record of a day in the life of an eminent yet elusive artist. Quotes by O'Keeffe about New Mexico and brief biographies of the painter and Loengard add extra dimension to the images. <i>--A.C. Smith</i>John Loengard, born in New York City in 1934, recieved his first assignment for Life magazine in 1956 and joined the magazine&#x2019;s staff in 1961.

In their relentless quest for technological perfection, they have destroyed entire star systems, enslaved countless peoples, and, in a single brutal attack, decimated Starfleet's mightiest vessels. <p>Answering a distress call from a planet under attack by the Borg, the <i>U.S.S.

But the <i>U.S.S.

Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago. He taught at Yale, University of Paris, University of Toronto, Tel Aviv University, and Cornell, where he was the recipient of the Clark Teaching Award in 1967. He died in 1992.Bloom, author of the best-selling The Closing of the American Mind, has brought together a group of leading constitutional scholars to discuss, in light of the crumbling of Communism and Socialism around the world, this amazingly durable American document. The authors offer both praise and criticism in looking backward to the philosophical foundations found in the writings of Rousseau, Jefferson, and The Federalist Papers and in looking forward to examine constitutional thinking from the 19th century to the present. The central question addressed is: Can this two-centuries-old document survive postconstitutional thought? Bloom presents a brilliant and balanced collection of essays. Highly recommended for anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the Constitution.<br><i>- Raymond Frey, Centenary Coll., Hackettstown, N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Practice Island Instructor Manual: Second Edition</h2><p>Practice Island contains 100 four-level analysis practice sentences.

The steward has said we will dock at 9am, but I am too excited to sleep, and I walk onto deck in the dark, long before the sun comes up, watching for the first sight of land. I pull a packet of cigarettes from my coat pocket, light one and inhale, smoke curling up into the warm night sky. My heart beats out a rhythm born of long anticipation. After six years I am finally coming home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lamp casts a small pool of light onto a black metal bench. Someone has left a book behind, and I pick it up. <i>The Settler&#x2019;s Guide to Up-Country Swahili: Exercises for the Soldier, Settler, Miner, Merchant and their Wives</i>.&nbsp; I open it and cast my eye over the introduction. <i>This book aims at teaching, in a simple way, just that degree of Swahili that is understood and talked by the average intelligent up-country native.</i> A curious use of adjectives, not something you would find in England. It is a long time since I have used my Swahili and I wonder how much will come back to me. The book starts with greetings, and I turn the phrases over silently on my tongue, enjoying the familiar rhythm of the words <i>Jambo Bwana. Jambo Memsaab. Habari Gani hapa? Habari mzuri tu, Bwana</i>. What&#x2019;s the news here? <i>Only good news, Bwana</i>. I slip the book into my pocket, unconsciously reciting the phrases as I stare out into the dark, waiting for our arrival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An hour later the sun rises huge and heavy from the horizon. Through a screen of mist I make out the shadow of Mombasa island. A couple wander onto deck, clutching cups of coffee and bread rolls, whispering excitedly. My eyes are fixed on what lies ahead. Green coconut palms and a scattering of white buildings emerge out of water so blue that I realise I have forgotten the meaning of colour. The sky is clear and limitless. In England &#x2013; a country in the grip of rationing, where the sun struggles to illuminate even the clearest winter day - no one has understood my descriptions of the sky in Kenya. My skin burns in the early morning sun, my neck damp beneath the weight of my hair. The white sails of the Arab dhows soar like the wings of huge, prehistoric birds, their decks crammed so full of Africans, grinning and shouting, clinging to every mast, that sinking seems an inevitability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They shout up their greetings in Swahili. <i>Karibu</i>. Welcome. And I grin down at them, waving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We dock, and I step giddily down the gangplank into a city that smells of fish, of salt, of acrid wood smoke and sewage &#x2013; the smell of a city whose people live life outdoors under a hot sun - down into the sweltering heat of the customs sheds where I am left waiting, sweating for a few hours before being released onto the small, crowded streets of Mombasa&#x2019;s port.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bougainvillea tumble over white walls, purple, orange, crimson red, amidst the trumpets of white datura flowers and clusters of pink hibiscus. Dhow captains spread their intricately woven carpets on the street for sale, beating out the dust in thick clouds. Porters in bare feet and white lunghis pad across the hot cobbles between piles of old newspaper and fish bones, past the Arab men dressed in white robes, who sit on low wooden stools drinking tea. I can smell roasting fish rising from a charcoal fire tended by two sailors in brightly coloured kikoys, who stand prodding the coals, spitting out jets of red betel nut into the street, while others unload their cargo &#x2013; boxes of fish, dates, henna, great piles of copper wire. Indian women in saris gossip in close groups. I stand and watch, dazzled by so much noise and colour, happiness soaring inside me. I have escaped England. I am back in Africa. But I am not home yet. There are still four hundred miles to travel, up country, before I see the farm, before I see my father.</p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Aleela</i>,&#x201d; a voice says behind me, and a hand touches me on the shoulder. <i>Aleela &#x2013; she cries</i> in <i>Swahili</i>. It was the name the Africans had given me as a baby, when I was born healthy, after my mother had given birth to a child who never breathed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turn and see Kahiki, our headman, standing there, his stick in one hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Jambo</i> I say, smiling as hard as I have ever smiled in my life.</p><p><i>Jambo Sana </i>he answers, his eyes smiling back at me, grasping my outstretched hand in his sinewy one. And &#x2013; just like that &#x2013; I have come home.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>II</b></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We come out onto the main road, into a cacophony of beeping and shouting. There has been an accident. A truck carrying pigs has turned over in the middle of the road and the traffic is at a standstill. A crowd of Africans gather round, watching. Tight rolls of pig flesh squeeze out of the slatted sides, their squeals sharpening the gloopy midday heat. <i>Downers</i> my uncle used to call them; pigs which were all cut up. He owns Uplands &#x2013; the bacon factory which supplies Kenya&#x2019;s Europeans and safari outfits with the sausages, hams and pork pies that remind them of home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We nudge our way past, the pigs grunting as they struggle to find a footing on the small slither of space which forms the side panel of the truck. Those who do find a foothold on the floor, are being crushed under the weight of those on top. The truck emits a dark, dense heat, palpable with the wet stench of their panic, and the dry chafing of their bristles. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They must have been on their way to the train which would take them to the factory. They&#x2019;ll be loaded anyway, once they get the truck back on the road; and finished off when they get there. I look away, struggling to suppress the memories which are threatening to take shape inside me. I have forgotten this other side of Kenya: a raw physicality that has no shame in the inevitability of pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The jeep is parked just beyond the truck. &nbsp;Kahiki throws my luggage into the back and I see a man of about my father&#x2019;s age, with a closely cut blond beard, and a dark, suntanned face, making his way through the crowd towards us. He is wearing tattered khaki shorts and desert boots, and he holds a black camera in one hand. He is broad and tall, and moves easily, though his face is creased with sun and age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Rachel?&#x201d; He holds out a large hand, and grasps mine in his. &#x201c;Nathaniel Logan. Good to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I say, unsure why he is here. His voice has the mellow, slow drawl of an American. He is a curious mix of down at heel, and well kitted out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He gets into the driver&#x2019;s seat, and I realise, with a swallow of disappointment, what I hadn&#x2019;t trusted myself to ask Kahiki &#x2013; that my father has not come to meet me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nathanial Logan leans over and opens the passenger door with one hand, &#x201c;Your father asked me to pick you up. He&#x2019;s stuck at the farm. They&#x2019;ve had some trouble with the harvest.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stows his camera in a box, then glances up at me, standing in the street. &#x201c;Hey kiddo, it&#x2019;s not so bad. I won&#x2019;t bite.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I swing myself up into the passenger seat. Kahiki is in the back. The American starts the engine, and hands me a bunch of bananas, toy size and sunflower yellow. I tear one off the bunch, peel it and bite into an almost impossible sweetness - after three weeks of tinned food on the ship, the sensation of something so sun soaked and sweet makes me catch my breath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The truck turned over an hour ago.&#x201d; Nathanial pulls the car out into the road, his hand on the horn, the crowd parting to let us through. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they let the pigs out?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t want even more of a mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once we have manoeuvred onto the clear road, he looks at me and smiles. &#x201c;First time back in a long while?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Six years.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you missed it like hell.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I smile back at him. He has just about summed it up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The white houses of Mombasa give way to lush vegetation, banana palms and fruit trees. He must sense the question in my silence, because he says, &#x201c;I was coming as far as Nairobi anyway. I needed to buy some gear.&#x201d; He gestures at the back of the Land Rover and I see a tarpaulin strapped over the boot. &#x201c;Trying to keep the dust out. Damn stuff corrodes the kit.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know my father?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been staying at Matebele for the last couple of months.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;With the Markhams?&#x201d; Matebele was a farm about an hour&#x2019;s drive from Kisima. Lillian Markham had been my mother&#x2019;s closest friend, and we had written to each other over the last six years. &#x201c;What are you doing up there?&#x201d; Our corner of Kenya was out of the way, and we rarely had visitors who weren&#x2019;t farmers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working for the American Museum of Natural History. Trying to track white rhino. I&#x2019;ve found some good specimens up in Laikipia, near the Markham&#x2019;s farm.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;To hunt?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;To photograph. This man &#x2013; &#x201d; He turns in his seat and grins at Kahiki, &#x201c; &#x2013;found them for me. One of the best trackers I&#x2019;ve ever met.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kahiki nods at Nathaniel, which is as close as he comes to smiling. He is Dorobo. He is small and strong, and made of muscle. He has quick eyes and clever hands. He carved wooden toys for me as a child, his knife shaping the wood into a lioness or baboon that was so real it was as though his hands had coaxed it into life. He knew the land better than anyone else on the farm &#x2013; he could track any bird or animal. He could find the claw marks of a leopard on a yellow barked acacia, and tell you how long before he had climbed down, and when he had last made a kill. He hunted with a bow and arrow, and I used to love watching the flick of the thin arrow floating high up into the air, its soft flight belying the deadly accuracy of its aim. It was Kahiki who set the trap for a lioness who was raiding my father&#x2019;s cattle; who found an elephant tusk buried deep in the earth which weighed nearly ninety pounds, the largest ever recorded on our land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You used to take me into the forest, and call for the honey guide bird &#x2013; do you remember?&#x201d; I ask Kahiki in Swahili.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Aleela. And you would not eat the honey in the forest for fear that the bees would come back for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laugh &#x2013; remembering. &#x201c;The honey guide would lead us to a hive nesting in the branches of a tree and Kahiki would rub sticks into fire, and smoke out the bees. When we had collected what we wanted we used to leave the comb for the honey guide &#x2013; &#x201d; I turn to Kahiki &#x2013; &#x201c;&#x2013; You always said that the bird would next time lead us to a mamba if we did not.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And it is true.&#x201d; He replies, his yellowing brown eyes soft on mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Kahiki used to walk with my mother.&#x201d; I say, feeling a sliver of pain in remembering, but pleasure too in sharing this, like the turning of a tooth. I can see the sitting room where she worked at Kisima, the long shelf crammed full of strange objects gathered from the land. And the early morning walks along the narrow tracks that spun like spider&#x2019;s webs through the dense bush, Kahiki in front, his bow in one hand, my mother&#x2019;s footsteps just behind my own. &#x201c;She used to collect things.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of things?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fossils, bones, bits of stone. Anything that hadn&#x2019;t moved in a thousand years. That&#x2019;s what my father used to say.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She was interested in palaeontology?&#x201d;.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; I say, realising as I say it that there is very little that I do know. I knew her only as my mother; the feel of her hands, rough and warm against my skin, the dry smell of the sun on her hair, the quick laugh that transformed her face. &#x201c;She used to say that the first humans came from Africa.&#x201d; I have not remembered it until now, and I realise that this is what Kenya will do for me. It will unlock those hidden places, and bring them out tight and full of pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not impossible. Darwin thought it might be true.&#x201d; He glances at me as he drives, &#x201c;Are you interested in Natural History?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>I shake my head. &#x201c;I was a child when I left Kenya. I didn&#x2019;t know anything about Natural History.&#x201d; And as I say it I hear the bitter edge to my voice; that my mother eludes me; that I did not know her better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turn in my seat, asking Kahiki about the farm, my father, his children, eager for any news he can give me, and happy to find that my Swahili is coming back to me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;They are good,&#x201d; Kahiki says, nodding his head, &#x201c;All good <i>Aleela,</i>&#x201d; but he is not a man who likes to talk, and I will have to wait until I am home to see how things are at the farm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We drive through the outskirts of Mombasa, past the corrugated shacks and road side stalls that make up the straggling edges of the city. Nathaniel overtakes two police jeeps, the officers dressed in soft khaki shirts tucked into holsters, rifles pointing in the air. One of the soldiers takes off his red beret and puckers his mouth in a silent whistle as we drive past, and I look away, embarrassed in front of Kahiki and the American.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of trouble?&#x201d; I ask, remembering what Nathaniel had said about the harvest. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A couple of nights ago someone broke into the barns at Kisima. Your father had just brought in the grain. They didn&#x2019;t take much &#x2013; a few bags. The police are making enquiries.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Was anyone hurt?&#x201d; The newspapers on the ship were littered with stories of Mau Mau &#x2013; the secret society which had sprung up in Kenya. It was said that they wanted to unite the Kikuyu and overthrow the whites. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; He glances at me, &#x201c;it was more than likely a simple case of theft.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But nothing more than a bag of sugar had ever gone missing at the farm. Who would risk breaking into my father&#x2019;s barns? </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When sleep washes over me I am standing by the dam at Kisima. My mother is kneeling on the bank with her back to me, slacks hitched, her fingers feeling for something buried in the earth. Her blond hair is plaited &#x2013; the same plait she used to work into my own hair, my scalp tingling with the tug of her fingers. The sun glows through the fine hairs that have worked loose, and she draws one arm across her face to wipe the sweat from her eyes.<i> </i>I run towards her &#x2013; <i>Mama</i>! With a flood of relief I see that she has heard me, but as she turns the dream dissolves and I have not seen her face. I jolt awake. The car rattles over the road. Nathaniel Logan is driving, one elbow resting on the open window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must have slept for longer than I thought. We are in open country. The plains of the central highlands stretch into the hazy distance like the shimmering, tawny back of a lion. Herds of wildebeest and zebra mingle in the long grass, and far off I can see elephant moving, their bodies silhouetted against the afternoo...</p></p><h2>Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix.

By the author of Amelia Earhart: A Biography.</p><p><b>Doris L. Rich </b>has had a varied career as a reporter, writer, photographer, and teacher that has taken her all over the world, from Michigan to Guam, Korea, Shanghai, Bangladesh, and Africa. She is also the author of <i>Amelia Earhart: A Biography </i>(Smithsonian, 1996).Rich (Amelia Earhart, 1989) sympathetically limns the extraordinary life of a woman who courageously defied gender and race to become the first African-American to earn an international pilot's license. While admitting that the scant amount of written material about Bessie Coleman has affected the scope of her book, Rich has nonetheless crafted the recollections of aging relatives, friends, and eyewitnesses, as well as press clippings and Coleman's few letters, into a vivid portrait of a remarkable woman. Born in 1892 in Atlanta, Texas, Coleman found her hitherto happy childhood changing when her father, a day laborer, left Texas in search of better work, and when school became an intermittent thing, squeezed in between cotton-picking and housework. Determined to make something of herself, the future aviatrix headed for Chicago, where she studied to become a manicurist. Though the work brought good money, as well as contacts with leaders of the black community, it failed to satisfy. On the spur of the moment, Coleman, hearing talk of French women fliers, ``decided that flying would provide a way to be noticed.'' Unable to train in the US, the ever-resourceful young woman got financial backing and sailed to France. There, she earned her license in 1921, two years before Amelia Earhart. Returning home as a celebrity, she flew in air shows, performed daring stunts, and--described as ``the world's greatest woman flyer''--spoke widely about the need for blacks to learn to fly. But segregation, sexism, and several accidents made Coleman's life difficult and thwarted her ambition to open a flying school. In 1926, just as her life seemed to be turning around, she died in a crash. A timely and engaging introduction to a woman of stunning accomplishment and courage who deserves a place of high honor in the pantheon of early flying.

Besides its 100 recipes and 60 photographs, the book includes a useful dictionary of Persian cooking techniques and ingredients, and a brief history of Persian cookery. Together these make a complete introduction to this wonderful cuisine.</p><p>Najmieh Batmanglij is a chef, culinary historian and teacher, whose previous cookbooks--New Food of Life, and Persian Cooking for a Healthy Kitchen--established her as the leading authority on Iranian cuisine. Her Silk Road Cooking: A Vegetarian Journey was selected as one of The New York Times s vegetarian cookbooks of 2004. Her most recent book is From Persia to Napa: Wine at the Persian Table.Rose petals, angelica powder, barberries and dried Persian limes are among the unusual elements that will awaken Western palates in the fare served up by chef and teacher Batmanglij (New Food of Life). Before presenting an array of recipes aimed at the adventurous cook, she notes that the cuisine of Persia (known as Iran, since 1935) is akin to Chinese in that it is thousands of years old. Some dishes, such as Shish Kabab and other skewered meals, are familiar, but many will be decidedly exotic to the uninitiated: Pistachio Soup is based on the nut with a name derived from a Persian word; Sweet and Sour Stuffed Chicken boasts a filling of onion, garlic, prunes, apples, dried apricots and cinnamon; a spice rarely used in this country flavors Grilled Fish with Sumac. Thirteen braised dishes known as khoreshes include Rhubarb Khoresh, which can be made with either chicken or red meat. Most Persian rice dishes are cooked so that a savory golden crust, known as tah dig, forms on the bottom. Desserts include Rose Water Rice Pudding and a labor-intensive Baklava. Cooks accustomed to simple recipes will find other complicated offerings, such as Jeweled Rice, but most are not overly intimidating. Color photos and a dictionary of terms and ingredients are helpful, as is a resource guide to groceries and restaurants. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Complete Photo Guide to Hand Lettering and Calligraphy: The Essential Reference for Novice and Expert Letterers and Calligraphers</h2><p><b>Written by best-selling author and hand letterer Abbey Sy,&nbsp;<i>The Complete Photo Guide to Hand Lettering and Calligraph</i>y covers the basics and beyond for creative lettering techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><br> The book&nbsp;begins with an overview of tools and materials, both traditional (pointed pen and fountain pen) and modern (including brush markers and chalk), then presents a visual glossary of letterforms, highlights the unique characteristics of the featured alphabets, and demonstrates how to draw letterforms to foster an understanding of how they&#x2019;re created.&nbsp;The core chapters explore traditional, modern, and special effects lettering using a variety of mark-making tools, with in-depth how-to on adding flourishes and other special details, plus creative projects.

D. Salinger&#x2014;and you don't think to tell me about it?"<br><br>Keri Daniels sucked the last dregs of her too-fruity smoothie through her straw and shrugged at her boss. "Would <em>you</em> want anybody to know?"<br><br>"That I had sex with Joseph Kowalski?"<br><br>"No, that you had sex in the backseat of a '78 Granada." Keri had no idea how Tina Deschanel had gotten the dirt on her high school indiscretions, but she knew she was in trouble.<br><br>An exceptionally well-paid reporter for a glossy weekly entertainment magazine did not withhold carnal knowledge of a celebrity on the editor in chief's most-wanted list. And having kept that juicy little detail to herself wouldn't get Keri any closer to parking her butt in an editorial chair.<br><br>Tina slipped a photograph from her purse and slid it across the table. Keri didn't look down. She was mentally compiling a short list of the people who knew she'd fogged up the windows of one of the ugliest cars in the history of fossil fuels. Her friends.<br><br>The cop who'd knocked on the fogged-up window with a flashlight at a really inopportune moment. Her parents, since the cop was in a bad mood that night. The approximately six hundred kids attending her high school that year and anybody <em>they'd</em> told. Maybe <em>short list</em> wasn't the right term.<br><br>"That was like two decades ago," Keri pointed out, because her boss clearly expected her to say something. "Not exactly a current event. And you ambushed me with this shopping spree."<br><br>Actually, their table in the outdoor cafe was surrounded by enough bags to stagger a pack mule on steroids, but now Keri knew she'd merely been offered the retail therapy <em>before</em> the bad news. It shouldn't have surprised her. Tina Deschanel was a shark, and any friendly gesture should have been seen as a prelude to getting bitten in the ass.<br><br>"Ambushed?" Tina repeated, loudly enough to distract a pair of Hollywood starlets engaging in some serious public displays of affection in a blatant attempt to attract the cheap tabloid paparazzi. A rabid horde that might include Keri in the near future if she didn't handle this correctly.<br><br>"How do you think I felt?" Tina went on. "I reached out to a woman who mentioned on her blog she'd gone to high school with Joseph Kowalski. once there was money on the table, I made her cough up some evidence, and she sent me a few photos. She was even kind enough to caption them for me."<br><br>Keri recognized a cue when it was shoved down her throat. With one perfectly manicured nail she hooked the eight-by-ten blowup and pulled it closer.<br><br>A girl smiled at her from the photo. She wore a pink fuzzy sweater, faded second-skin jeans and pink high heels. Raccoon eyeliner made her dark brown eyes darker, frosty pink coated her lips and her hair was as big as Wisconsin.<br><br>Keri smiled back at her, remembering those curling iron and aerosol days. If the EPA had shut down their cheerleading squad back then, global warming might have been a total nonissue today.<br><br>Then she looked at the boy. He was leaning against the hideous brown car, his arms wrapped around young Keri's waist. Joe's blue eyes were as dark as the school sweatshirt he wore, and his grin managed to be both innocent and naughty at the same time. And those damn dimples&#x2014;she'd been a sucker for them. His honey-brown hair was hidden by a Red Sox cap, but she didn't need to see it to remember how the strands felt sliding through her fingers.<br><br>She never failed to be amazed by how much she still missed him sometimes.<br><br>But who had they been smiling at? For the life of her, Keri couldn't remember who was standing behind the camera. She tore her gaze away from the happy couple and read the caption typed across the bottom.<br><br><em>Joe Kowalski and his girlfriend, Keri Daniels, a few hours before a cop busted them making out on a back road and called their parents. Rumor had it when Joe dropped her off, Mr. Daniels chased him all the way home with a golf club.</em><br><br>Keri snorted. "Dad only chased him to the end of the block. Even a '78 Granada could outrun a middle-age fat guy with a five iron."<br><br>"I fail to see the humor in this."<br><br>"You didn't see my old man chasing taillights down the middle of the street in his bathrobe. It wasn't very funny at the time, though."<br><br>"Focus, Keri," Tina snapped. "Do you or do you not walk by the bulletin board in the bull pen every day?"<br><br>"I do."<br><br>"And have you not seen the sheet marked <em>Spotlight Magazine's</em> Most Wanted every day?"<br><br>"I have."<br><br>"And did you happen to notice Joseph Kowal-ski has been number three for several years?" Keri nodded, and Tina leaned across the table. "You are going to get me an exclusive feature interview with the man."<br><br>"Or...?"<br><br>Tina sat back and folded her arms across her chest. "Don't take it to that point, Keri. Look, the man's eleventh bestseller is going to be <em>the</em> summer blockbuster film of the decade. More A-listers lined up to read for that movie than line up on the red carpet for the Oscars. And he's a total mystery man."<br><br>"I don't get why you're so dedicated to chasing him down. He's just an author."<br><br>"Joseph Kowalski isn't just an author. He played the media like a fiddle and became a celebrity. The splashy NY parties with that gorgeous redhead&#x2014; Lauren Huckins, that was it&#x2014;on his arm. Then Lauren slaps him with a multimillion dollar emotional distress suit, he pays her off with a sealed agreement and then he disappears from the map? There's a story there, and I want it. Our readers will eat him up, and <em>Spotlight</em> is going to serve him to them because you have access to him nobody else does."<br><br>"Had. I <em>had</em> access to him." Keri sighed and flipped the photo back across the table, even though she would rather have kept it to moon over later. "Eighteen years ago."<br><br>"You were his high school sweetheart. Nostalgia, darling! And rumor has it he's still single."<br><br>Keri <em>knew</em> he was still single because the Danielses and Kowalskis still lived in the same small New Hampshire town, though Mr. and Mrs. Kowalski lived in a much nicer house now. Very <em>much</em> nicer, according to Keri's mother.<br><br>"You've risen fast in this field," Tina continued, "because you have sharp instincts and a way with people, to say nothing of the fact I trusted you. But this."<br><br>The words trailed away, but Keri heard her boss loud and clear. She was going to get this exclusive or her career with <em>Spotlight</em> was over and she could start fresh at the bottom of another magazine's totem pole. And since her career was pretty much the sum total of her life, it wasn't exactly a threat without teeth.<br><br>But seeing Joe again? The idea both intrigued her and scared the crap out of her at the same time. "He's not going to open up his insanely private life to the magazine because he and I wore out a set of shocks in high school, Tina. It was fun, but it wasn't <em>that</em> good."<br><br>Now she was flat-out lying. Joe Kowalski had set the gold standard in Keri's sex life. An ugly car, a Whitesnake tape, cheap wine and Joe still topped her personal Ten Ways to a Better Orgasm list.<br><br>Tina ran her tongue over her front teeth, and Keri had known her long enough to know her boss was about to deliver the kill shot.<br><br>"I've already reassigned your other stories," she said. It was an act of interference entirely inappropriate for Tina to do to someone of Keri's status at the magazine.<br><br>"That's unacceptable, Tina. You're overstepping your&#x2014;"<br><br>"I can't overstep boundaries I don't have, Daniels. It's my magazine and your promotion to editorial depends on your getting an interview with Kowalski, plain and simple." Then she reached into her purse and passed another sheet to her. "Here's your flight information."<br><br>The reclusive, mega-bestselling author in question was trying to decide between regular beef jerky or teriyaki flavored when he heard Keri Daniels was back in town.<br><br>Joe Kowalski nodded at the cashier, who'd actually left a customer half-rung up in an attempt to be the first to deliver the news. It wasn't the first time Keri had been back. If she'd gone eighteen years without a visit home to her parents, Janie Daniels would have flown out to L.A. and dragged her daughter home by an earlobe.<br><br>It was, however, the first time Keri had come looking for him that he knew of.<br><br>"She's been asking around for your phone number," the cashier added, watching him like a half-starved piranha. "Of course nobody will give it to her, because we know how you feel about your privacy."<br><br>And because nobody had his number, but he didn't feel a need to point that out. He was surprised it had taken Keri as long as this to get around to looking him up, especially considering just how many years Tina Deschanel had been stalking his agent.<br><br>"Maybe she's on the class reunion committee," Joe told the cashier, and her face fell. Committees didn't make for hot gossip.<br><br>Members of the media had been hounding his agent for years, but only Tina Deschanel, who took tenacious to a whole new level, was Keri Daniels's boss. Joe had been watching Keri's career from the beginning, waiting for her to sell him out, but she never had. until now, maybe.<br><br>While he wasn't a recluse of Salingeresque stature, Joe liked his privacy. The New England dislike of outsiders butting into their lives, combined with his own fiscal generosity&#x2014;in the form of a ballpark, playgrounds, library donations or whatever else they needed&#x2014;kept the locals from spilling his business. By the time he'd struck it big, classmates who'd moved away didn't remember enough about him to provide interesting fodder.<br><br>Nobody knew the details of the lawsuit settlement except the lawyers, his family and Lauren&#x2014;who would be financially devastated should she choose to break her silence. And, as unlikely as it seemed, he and Keri had never been linked together in the media reports his publicist monitored. He managed to keep his private life pretty much just that, despite the hype surrounding the movie.<br><br>"You're not old enough for a class reunion," Tiffany said, batting her way-too-young eyelashes at him.<br><br><em>A half dozen of each,</em> he decided, tossing bags of beef jerky into his cart. He had a lot more list than cart space left and he kicked himself for not making Terry come along. She could have pushed a second cart <em>and</em> run interference on nosy cashiers. She was good in the role, probably from years of experience.<br><br>As if on cue, the loudspeaker crackled. "Um... Tiffany, can you come back to register one, please? I have to pick up my kids in ten minutes."<br><br>The girl rolled her eyes and started back toward the front of the town's tiny market, but not before calling over her shoulder, "She's staying with her parents, but I guess you already know where they live."<br><br>Yeah, he guessed he did, too. The only question was what he was going to do about it. He and his entire family were preparing to leave town for two weeks, and it would be a shame if he missed out on whatever game Keri was playing.<br><br>Assuming it was even true. Not that she was in town, but that she wanted to give him a call. In his experience, if there wasn't enough dirt to keep a small-town grapevine bearing fruit, people would just add a heaping pile of manufactured fertilizer.<br><br>Joe gave a row of pepperoni sticks the thousand-yard stare. If Keri Daniels <em>was</em> looking for his phone number, it had to mean somebody had spilled the beans. The rabid pit bull of a woman she worked for must have discovered her star reporter was once the girl of Joe's dreams. If that was the case, he and Keri were heading for a reunion, and <em>this</em> time Keri could do the begging, just as he had before she'd run off to california.<br><br>Two hours later, after he'd unloaded his groceries at his own place, he faced his twin sister across the expanse of their mother's kitchen. Theresa Kowal-ski Porter was <em>not</em> a happy woman.<br><br>"You are one dumb son of a bitch."<br><br>Whereas he liked to play with words&#x2014;savor them&#x2014;Terry just spat them out as they popped into her head.<br><br>"I thought you were a moron for putting up with her shit then," she said. "But now you're going back for a second helping?"<br><br>"I'm ninety-nine percent sure her boss sent her out here in order to use our history to manipulate me into giving the magazine an interview."<br><br>"Keri Daniels never needed any help when it came to manipulating people. And I don't even want to think about that other one percent on an empty stomach."<br><br>The entire Kowalski family had once held some resentment toward Keri, but Terry's had festered. Not only because his sister knew how to hold a grudge&#x2014;although she certainly did&#x2014;but because Keri had hurt her even before she'd gotten around to hurting Joe.<br><br></p><h2>If I Had Long, Long Hair</h2><p>Loretta ponders both the good and bad things that might happen if she had long, long hair, hair long enough to flow around her like royal robes but also long enough for hamsters to nest in.</p><p>Angela Hunt is the author of the best-selling THE TALE OF THREE TREES and more than 120 other titles for adults and children.

Working from memory, Biba recalled her roots and recreated authentic Italian flavor in this most American of cities, and quickly became a local legend for her cooking classes and, ultimately for her famously delicious restaurant, Biba.</p><p> Biba's fantastic, simple dishes represent what the Italians call <em>la buona cucina casalinga</em>--more commonly known as "good home cooking"--and are now available to all in <em>From Biba's Italian Kitchen.</em></p><p> Biba's foolproof method relies on the senses, not on the repetition of rigid recipes. Do the tomatoes at the market look particularly fresh? Then it's time to whip up a quick <em>puttanesca</em> sauce to top practically any pasta or meat dish. Are the porcini mushrooms especially eye-catching today? A tangy and woodsy sauce of porcini and tomatoes for. delicate spinach-ricotta gnocchi is just minutes away. Did a batch of walnuts just arrive from your aunt out West? Walnut pesto is the only proper reply. Biba trusts her (and your)impulses, and encourages a casual but committed approach to food, two hallmarks of <em>la dolce vita,</em> the sweet life that <em>From Biba's Italian Kitchen promotes on every page.</em></p><p> Biba starts with a staple of Italian cooking: the elegant, integral <em>antipasti.</em> Simple or sophisticated <em>antipasti</em> show the instruments of the Italian symphony tuning up before the first act. Gorgeous red bell peppers nestle with hunks of Italian bread and are topped by verdant parsley to make luscious <em>bruschetta,</em> plump little artichokes nuzzle with sun-dried tomatoes for sun-drenched <em>carciofini all'olio;</em> and fresh eggs with earthy potatoes and onions blend to create rustic <em>fritatta di patate e cipolle.</em></p><p> The harmony continues into the main dishes, a cavalcade of pasta, meat, and fish dishes that catch attention without disrupting a schedule. Prepare in haste and enjoy in leisure such delicacies as seafood cannelloni, delectably bitter pasta with broccoli rabe, succulent osso buco, veal shank with tomatoes and peas, or classic <em>tagliatelle</em> with sweet prosciutto and fresh tomatoes.</p><p> A chapter on vegetable side dishes (whether grilled, saut�ed, baked, stuffed, roasted, braised, or steamed) shows how <em>primizie</em>--the first, freshest produce of the season--bring the vegetable garden to the urban table. Complete sections on pizza (of course!),<em>risotti,</em> the light yet hearty dishes, made from Italian arborio rice, and <em>polenta,</em> the scrumptious cornmeal preparation that is the perfect foil to vegetable and meat alike, round out Biba's memorable <em>tavola calda.</em></p><p>And dessert!Italian desserts! Juicy fig and jam tart, sinful mascarpone-zabaglione mousse, juicy strawberries in red wine, and apple and amaretti cake serve as an elegant, graceful cadenza to the mellifluous meals in <em>From Biba's Italian Kitchen.</em>Striking every grace note, Biba conducts her culinary symphony, Biba conducts her culinary symphony with verve, and makes a maestro of every cook.</p></p><p>Biba Caggiano is the author of <em>Northern Italian Cooking,</em> <em>Modern Italian Cooking,</em> and <em>Leo Buscaglia's Love Cookbook</em> with Biba Caggiano, <em>From Biba's Italian Kitchen,</em> and <em>Italy alDente.</em> Her cooking show, <em>Biba's Kitchen,</em> was seen on the Learning Channel, and she is the chef/owner of Biba's restaurant in Sacramento, California, where she lives.From Spinach, Ricotta and Mascarpone Dumplings to a Chianti-enhanced Lamb and Potato Stew, this gathers a range of diverse and often unusual dishes from Caggiano's Italian heritage, presenting a solid collection of both Italian basics and diversions from the norm. Newcomers to Italian cuisine will find this particularly inviting, while pros will find plenty of innovations. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Story of King Arthur and His Knights, The (Leatherbound Classic Collection) by Howard Pyle (2011) Bonded Leather</h2><p>This title is suitable for children aged 10 to 13 years old. This imaginative retelling of the classic Arthurian legends recounts the story of Arthur&#39;s formation of the Knights of the Round Table, his securing of the enchanted sword Excalibur and his wooing of the Lady Guinevere. Included as well are the legends of Sir Pelleas, the story of Sir Gawaine&#39;s pursuit of the White Hart and tales of Merlin the magician, Morgana Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake and many others. One of the best-loved classics of children&#39;s literature, &#34;The Story of King Arthur and His Knights&#34; is magnificently illuminated with artwork of Howard Pyle that brings the pomp and pageantry of Camelot magically to life. This exquisite full-colour edition features an elegant bonded-leather binding, a satin-ribbon bookmark, distinctive stained edging and decorative endpapers. It&#39;s a book that will be cherished by readers of all ages.</p><p>I am not the author but merely a private publisher. Howard Pyle was born in 1853 and was well known as an illustrator, training men such as N.C. Wyeth. My wife and I wanted to reproduce some of his works to be enjoyed by a younger generation and have entirely re-typeset all the books we published as well as cleaned up some of the images to make them suitable for reprinting. This was a labor of love and we hope you enjoy reading the books as much as we did. <br> <br>We have reprinted the four books about King Arthur and his knights as well as The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, all in a blue hardbound format.In this enchanting version of the story of King Arthur, the renowned American illustrator and storyteller Howard Pyle displays his unique talent for capturing and stimulating the imaginations of the young. Inventively retold and vividly illustrated, these stories describe the perilous and thrilling adventures of King Arthur and his knights in that glorious age of chivalry and honor.<br>After showing how Arthur established his right to the throne by drawing the sword from the anvil, the author then relates the story of Arthur's battle with the Sable Knight and his securing the sword Excalibur&#x2015;"the most beautiful and the most famous sword in all the world." He tells of Arthur's confrontations with the Duke of North Umber and Sir Pellias, describes King Arthur's wooing and wedding the Lady Guinevere, and tells of the establishment of the Round Table. Tales are told, too, of Arthur's knights, including Merlin the Wise, Sir Pellias (or the Gentle Knight) and of course, Sir Gawaine. One of the key points in the book is Arthur's search for the answer to the riddle "What is it that a woman most desires?" with his life at stake.<br>This is the definitive children's version of the Arthurian legend, for generations a special&nbsp;favorite with youngsters of all ages. Its reputation, richly&nbsp;deserved, rests as much upon the illustrations as on the delightful tales themselves. And no wonder, for as an illustrator of children's books, Pyle had no peer. Bold and unforgettable as only Pyle's skilled hand could make them, these drawings convey at a glance the whole aura of that splendid age and&nbsp;help to make this a book that boys and girls will cherish for years to come.<br>Unabridged and unaltered republication of the first (1903) edition.&nbsp;</p><h2>Splatterpunks II: Over the Edge</h2><p>Kirkus Reviews called Splatterpunks &#34;an authoritative and intelligent collection for horror fans willing to go all the way.&#34; Now, this second volume of taboo-shattering horror stories and essays goes beyond the limits of convention--into the darkest corners of the human soul.</p><p>A mosaic of viscera, excrement, sex, and degradation whirls before our eyes in this anthology of stories and essays that run the gamut from lame and pretentious to genuinely stunning. Sammon, a former film publicist turned literary schlockmeister (he edited Splatterpunks, 1990), introduces this volume with the boast, ``They're bad. They're back. They're women.'' Yes, female authors and characters do feature heavily in this Splatpack, but stories like Sammon's own flaccid entry, ``Within You, Without You'' (in which a rock band sexually mutilates a female teenage groupie on video), and essays such as Martin Amis's self-serving, decade-old interview of filmmaker Brian DePalma (whose oeuvre includes the sexist classics Body Double and Dressed to Kill) serve as a curious counterpoint to the stated focus. Among the better entries are Gorman Bechard's ``Pig,'' a wickedly funny tale about an all-woman vigilante hit squad in 21st-century Los Angeles that simultaneously evokes Philip K. Dick and the frenetic violence of Japanese adult comics; Nancy A. Collins's ``Rant,'' a chilling glimpse into the mind of a deluded messiah; Anya Martin's ``Rockin' the Midnight Hour,'' which examines the connections between horror and rock; and ``Calling Dr. Satan,'' Jim Goad's interview with Anton LaVey, self-proclaimed ``Black Pope'' of the Church of Satan and author of The Satanic Bible. A genre that alternately craves and shuns acceptance, Splatterpunk is (for those not familiar with buzzwords used to pigeonhole literature) an amalgam of slasher films, brooding metal/Goth-inspired rock, and basic naughtiness disguised as nihilism; the editor describes it as ``a method. An attitude. A state of mind.'' This exercise in combining incongruous media elements into one discordant whole could be the real cutting edge--but Sammon dulls it in introductory passages whose smugness and hipster wannabe posturing frequently undermine the authors' contributions. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Those looking for something very different, very bizarre, and very shocking may find this collection of visceral, graphic, lurid, often disgusting short stories compelling, but it's doubtful the book should be recommended for any but the most open-minded and strong-stomached reader. Written by some of the better-known authors in the horror genre (Kathe Koja, Clive Barker, Poppy Z. Brite, among them), the stories go beyond the bounds of taste and descend into mind-boggling shock/schlock. These tales sear the mind, evoking fright, horror, and disgust and revealing primal, instinctive (and perhaps best-forgotten) reactions. And yet, it's possible to admire the sheer courage of these authors for their fearlessness at penning such "in your face" works, to respect the bizarre brilliance of the minds that dream up such grotesque plots and characters, and to believe that such stories--offensive as they may be to some--do in fact have a place in today's libraries and bookstores, if for no other reason than to expand our minds, jolt us out of our complacency, and make us thankful for the mundane, traditional, and safe. <i>Emily Melton</i></p><h2>Portable Stephen Crane</h2><p>An essay on life during the Victorian era prefaces a collection of writings by leading British authors whose works reflect the values and concerns of the age.</p><p>Stephen Crane (1871&#x2013;1900) was active as a reporter around the world in addition to being an acclaimed novelist.</p><h2>The Legend of the Whistle Pig Wrangler</h2><p>This delightful western yarn of courage, perseverance, and hope tells how William and his horse, Pinto Bean, try to join the Castle Rock Wranglers on the day of the big cattle roundup.

The first surprise in <i>Allegiant</i> is that Roth has switched to using alternating narratives of Tris and Four. At last readers get to see Tris as Four sees her and if, like me, you&#x2019;ve been dying to get inside his head, you finally get your chance. One of the best things about this trilogy is the messy, passionate, and wholly authentic love story between these two. For Tris and Four, there is no love triangle, there are no sides to take--as in life, it&#x2019;s only a matter of how their relationship will play out. <i>Allegiant</i> answers a lot of questions and also delivers some jaw-dropping twists--readers will go outside the fence, learn the origin story of the factions, and, of course, see how it all ends in a finale that packs a wallop and confirms Roth as a writer to watch for a long time to come. --<i>Seira Wilson</i><p>One choice</p><p>One choice can transform you</p><p>One choice can destroy you</p><p>One choice will define you</p><p>#1 New York Times bestselling author Veronica Roth brings her blockbuster Divergent series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.</p><p>Bonus Materials Include: Updated Faction Histories Q&amp;A with Veronica Roth Allegiant Discussion Guide Excerpt from Four"</p></p><h2>Heart and the Bottle</h2><p><p>Once there was a girl who was full of wonderment at how the world worked.

Published for the first time in book form, <i>Wake Up</i> is Kerouac&#x2019;s retelling of the story of Prince Siddhartha Gautama, who as a young man abandoned his wealthy family and comfortable home for a lifelong search for Enlightenment. As a compendium of the teachings of the Buddha, <i>Wake Up</i> is a profound meditation on the nature of life, desire, wisdom, and suffering. Distilled from a wide variety of canonical scriptures, <i>Wake Up</i> serves as both a concise primer on the concepts of Buddhism and as an insightful and deeply personal document of Kerouac&#x2019;s evolving beliefs. It is the work of a devoted spiritual follower of the Buddha who also happened to be one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential novelists. <i>Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha</i> will be essential reading for the legions of Jack Kerouac fans and for anyone who is curious about the spiritual principles of one of the world&#x2019;s great religions.</p><p>Jack Kerouac(1922-1969), the central figure of the Beat Generation, was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922 and died in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1969. Among his many novels are <b>On the Road</b>, <b>The Dharma Bums</b>, <b>Big Sur</b>, and <b>Visions of Cody</b>.In 1958, Kerouac published his groundbreaking novel The Dharma Bums, which met with great acclaim and has since been heralded as the opening salvo of an indigenous American Buddhism. This fall, Viking is repackaging that novel in a 50th-anniversary edition while also releasing Kerouac's unsung and long-forgotten tale of the Buddha's life, published in book form for the first time. The titular theme of "wake up" is rehearsed throughout Kerouac's story of Prince Siddartha Gotama, who left an indolent but meaningless life of riches to embrace asceticism and enlightenment. Drawing on multiple sutras and accounts of the Buddha's life, Kerouac focuses on Gotama's renunciation of worldly things by repeating that trope with several other wealthy characters who forsake riches in favor of nirvana. The prose is as meandering as it is beautiful, with Kerouac's Buddha spouting memorable sayings about sensation, illusion, emptiness and suffering. If there is an almost evangelistic zeal to this loose collection of axioms and Buddhist conversion stories, Kerouac at least states that openly: "The purpose is to convert," he explains at the outset. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Using some of the great works of baseball fiction as well as the actual game's fantastic moments, its legendary characters, and its routine rituals&#x2014;from the long-sought triumph of the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, to the heroic achievements of players like the saintly Christy Mathewson and the sinful Ty Cobb, to the loving intimacy of a game of catch between a father and son&#x2014;Sexton teaches that through the game we can touch the spiritual dimension of life.<br><br><i>Baseball as a Road to God </i>is about the elements of our lives that lie beyond what can be captured in words alone&#x2014;ineffable truths that we know by experience rather than by logic or analysis.

Eliot Prize and the Forward Prize, <i>Black Cat Bone</i> is the first American publication of the poetry of John Burnside</b><br><b></b><br><i>Before the songs I sang there were the songs</i><br><i>they came from, patent shreds</i><br><i>of Babel, and the secret</i><br><i>Nineveh of back rooms in the dark.</i><br><i> </i><br><i>Hour after hour</i><br><i>the night trains blundered through</i><br><i>from towns so far away and innocent</i><br><i>that everything I knew seemed fictional:</i><br><i></i> &#x2015;from "Death Room Blues"</p><p>John Burnside's <i>Black Cat Bone</i> is full of poems of thwarted love and disappointment, raw desire, the stalking beast. One sequence tells of an obsessive lover coming to grief in echoes of the old murder ballads, and another longer poem describes a hunter losing himself in the woods while pursuing an unknown and possibly unknowable quarry.<i> Black Cat Bone</i> introduces American readers to one of the best poets writing across the Atlantic.</p></p><p><p><b>John Burnside</b> is a poet, fiction writer, and memoirist. His poetry has received the T. S. Eliot Prize, the Forward Prize, the Whitbread Poetry Award, and the Petrarca Preis. He lives in Fife, Scotland.</p><p>&#x201c;John Burnside's <i>Black Cat Bone</i> arrives in America as one of the most feral British collections of poems I've read in years. His voice is shot through with its own lyric genius, one that ruptures and raptures, hunts and hurts, and haunts and heals. The poems are bloodwarm, lucid, even in what he calls &#x2018;the curdled glaze of everafter.' He dares to sing of Song. He marries grace to gall. His daylight is carrion, he writes, but the light he casts at night is almost velvet to the touch. And he's a sneaky jackal of a formalist, tenderly rendering, stealthy and beguiling all at once. These poems provoke an &#x2018;infinite kinship' with their reader. I am utterly taken with Burnside's hand and craft and heart.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lucie Brock-Broido</i></p><p>&#x201c;The mystery of how this volume could be--after more than a dozen collections in the UK, not to mention novels, memoirs, short stories, and essays--the first book of John Burnside's poems to appear in the US is now immaterial. <i>Black Cat Bone</i> is Burnside at his best, and its appearance will make its readers want more. He is a poet of 'the sonar that runs in the spine.' He is, in other words, deeply in touch with what it means to walk upon this earth, and he delivers regularly electrifying expressions of the condition we call human. 'The only gift,' he writes, 'is knowing we belong / to nothing.' Now, however, his poems can belong to us, and that is something to celebrate. It's a gift, from one of the most important poets in the language.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert Wrigley</i></p><p>&#x201c;If genius is operating anywhere in English poetry at present, I feel it is here, in Burnside's singular music.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Thorpe, The Observer on John Burnside</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Burnside's] radiant meditations have been perhaps the most quietly and pervasively influential voice to have emerged in British poetry in the last twenty years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Don Paterson, New British Poetry on John Burnside</i></p></p><h2>Haggada of Passover</h2><p>This Haggada is inspired by the original Bird&#39;s Head Haggada which was published in Germany and is one of the oldest Haggadot dating back to the end of the 13th century. The Haggada is richly illustrated by movable pop-ups depicting major scenes such as The Crossing of the Red Sea, The Baking of Matzot, and The Ten Plagues etc. The original resides in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. The figures are drawn with birds&#39; heads and prominent beaks. The omissions of human faces or their replacement by animal-heads are found in other Ashkenazi Jewish manuscripts of the 13th and 14th centuries. A church edict in Germany in 1215 forced all male Jews to wear pointed hats, also reproduced here. Other images bear animal heads or protuberant noses. Some appear to have been deliberately defaced, or covered with a helmet. The Passover story is told in both Hebrew and English in this beautiful Haggada which is sure to become a family keepsake for young and old.</p><p></p><h2>The Transcendental Murder (Homer Kelly, Book 1)</h2><p>Thoreau, Emerson, and the Alcotts are discovered to have done more than they think, two people show up dead, and Lt.-Det., Emerson scholar, Homer Kelly is there</p><p>8 1-hour cassettesJane Langton has written 18 books in the &#34;Homer Kelly&#34; series but all the early titles have been out of print for at least 15 years, and mystery readers tend to be passionate about reading in series-order.

Peter created a cultural phenomenon&nbsp; with his brilliant, outrageous, hilarious, and all-too-true treatise on business and life, <em>The Peter Principle</em>&#x2014;and his words and theories are as true today as they were then. By posing&#x2014;and answering&#x2014;the eternal question, &#x201c;Why do things always go wrong?&#x201d; Peter explores the incompetence that runs so rampant through our society, our workplace, and our world in an outrageously funny yet honest and eye-opening manner. With a new foreword by Robert I. Sutton, bestselling author of <em>The No Asshole Rule</em>, this twenty-first century edition of Peter&#x2019;s classic is set to shake up the business world all over again.<br></p></p><p><p>This book caused a storm when first published in 1969, battering up the bestseller list to #1, charming readers from Topeka to Timbuktu, and finally, brilliantly, blessedly giving the world an answer to a question that nags us all: Why is incompetence so maddeningly rampant and so vexingly triumphant? The book and the phrase it defined are now considered comedic-yet-classic cornerstones of organizational thought, and in honor of the book's fortieth anniversary, Robert I. Sutton has written a foreword introducing the book to a new generation of readers.</p><p>The Peter Principle, the eponymous law Laurence Peter coined, explains that "in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence." Everyone&#x2014;from the office intern to the CEO, from the low-level civil servant to a nation's president&#x2014;will inevitably rise to his or her level of incompetence, if it hasn't happened already. Dr. Peter's glorious revelation explains why incompetence is at the root of everything we endeavor to do&#x2014;why schools bestow ignorance, why governments condone anarchy, why courts dispense injustice, why prosperity causes unhappiness, and why utopian plans never generate utopias.</p><p>With the wit of James Thurber or Mark Twain, the psychological and anthropological acuity of Sigmund Freud or Margaret Mead, and the theoretical impact of Isaac Newton or Copernicus, Dr. Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull's brilliant book explains how incompetence and its accompanying symptoms, syndromes, and remedies define the world and the work we do in it.</p><p>Laurence J. Peter was born in Canada and received an EdD from Washington State University. An experienced teacher, counselor, school psychologist, prison instructor, consultant, and university professor, he wrote articles for many journals and magazines as well as several books. He died in 1990. </p><br><br><p>Raymond Hull wrote many stage plays as well as articles for <em>Punch</em>, <em>Maclean&#x2019;s</em>, and <em>Esquire</em>. He died in 1985.</p></p><h2>Silence: The Mystery of Wholeness</h2><p>In this chaotic world, we need <i>Silence</i> to maintain and enlarge our inner connection with the mystery of the world, to find a sense of spiritual direction, and to become more receptive to healing from the spiritual worlds. Robert Sardello's exquisite descriptions of previously unrecognized dimensions of <i>Silence</i>, along with exercises, can help us find what we most long to feel&#x2014;an intimate sense of being cared for.<br><br>In <i><b>Silence,</b></i> Robert Sardello gives us nothing less than a gorgeous, sustained epiphany on <i>Silence</i> itself. From the trials of St. Anthony to Anthroposophy, Depth Psychology, and phenomenology, Sardello's erudition is always present, but never intrusive, since this work is also an experience. It is a palpable entry into <i>Silence</i> as it unfolds, offering each reader an intimation of its secrets.<br><br><br>"Sardello's work <i>Silence</i> sets a momentum into order every time I pick it up, on that asks only that I stay open to that momentum. I haven't encountered this kind of book before, and I don't know what's in it for me, only that I have a longing to stay open to it. I daresay the work will speak for itself. I can't speak for it except to pray it finds a very wide audience and works its magic thereon." <p>&#x2015;<b>Joseph Chilton Pearce</b>, author <i>The Magical Child</i> <br>and <i>The Death of Religion and the Rebirth of Spirit</i></p><br>"This book is a breakthrough. In <i>Silence</i>, Robert Sardello modestly, elegantly&#x2014;and magisterially&#x2014;brings thirty years of work in phenomenological, soul-based spiritual psychology to a new level. What was implicit before becomes explicit: spiritual psychology is not just another theory; it is a path to a new reality." <p>&#x2015;<b>Christopher Bamford,</b> author, <i>The Voice of the Eagle,</i> <br>and coauthor, <i>Green Hermeticism</i></p></p><p><b>Robert Sardello,</b> PhD, is cofounder (with Cheryl Sanders-Sardello, PhD, in 1992) of the School of Spiritual Psychology.

She makes a decision she would often find herself making - not to stay home, not to lead a quiet or predictable life, but to risk her life, to set out across the world, and to make a name for herself as one of a new generation of journalists created by the War on Terror.<i> It&#x2019;s What I Do</i> follows a course unavoidable for Addario - from her first camera and the pictures it inspired, to early years as a street photographer and the inspiration she found in the work of Sebasti�o Salgado. Photography becomes a way for her to travel with a purpose - a singular ambition that shapes and drives her.</p><p> From Afghanistan to Iraq to Darfur to Libya, Addario finds in photography not only the artistic medium to convey people&#x2019;s stories, but the power to change political policy by showing its consequences. As a woman photojournalist determined to be taken seriously, Addario fights her way into a boy&#x2019;s club of a profession, eventually earning widespread recognition. Refusing to turn down career-defining assignments, she puts romance and family on hold. Yet the sadness and injustice she encounters as a conflict reporter give her a new vision for her own life, and the more she sees of the world, the greater her desires for love and family grow. <i>It&#x2019;s What I Do</i> is also the story of how Addario met her husband and father to their child, and how as a war correspondent and a mother, she learned to live her life in two different - though hardly separate - worlds.</p><p> Watching uprisings unfold and people fight to the death for their freedom, Addario understands she is documenting not only news but also the fate of society. <i>It&#x2019;s What I Do</i> is more than just a snapshot of life on the front lines; it is witness to the human cost of war.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month for February 2015:</strong> &#x201c;Why do you do this?&#x201d; is the central question Lynsey Addario answers in her new memoir <i>It&#x2019;s What I Do</i>&#x2014;and she asks it not just for the reader, but it seems for herself. Addario is a MacArthur &#x201c;Genius&#x201d; grant recipient and was part of the team that won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting (covering the Taliban in Afghanistan with Dexter Filkins ) but her story often underscores her insecurities in her profession and personal life. Even with her numerous accolades, she worries about being forgotten, missing the breaking story and not being taken seriously as a woman. It&#x2019;s a frank, and refreshingly, candid look into a successful professional photojournalist at the top of her game but it never romanticizes the risks that are necessary to bring us her images. Her story is inspiring, heartbreaking and an eye opening look at what it takes to reveal events from the other side of the world. &#x2013;<i>Amy Huff</i></p><b>Lynsey Addario</b> is an American photojournalist whose work appears regularly in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>National Geographic</i>, and <i>Time</i> magazine.

But the son and daughter of the two chieftains are in love. Histrionix and the beautiful Melodrama have more sense than their fathers, and call in Asterix, Obelix and the druid Getafix to sort out the political wrangling. What with the intriguing of the sinister traitor Codfix, who wants to marry Melodrama himself, the Gauls&#39; work is cut out for them can they persuade the star-crossed lovers&#39; village to reunite against the threat of Julius Caesar&#39;s Roman legionaries?

He died in 1977. Albert Uderzo was born in 1927 in a small village in Marne, France. He met Rene Goscinny in 1951 and on 29 October 1959 their most famous creation, Asterix, made his first appearance on page 20 of Pilote. ASTERIX THE GAUL, their first album, was published in 1961 and there have now been 35 Asterix albums.Reviewed with Albert Uderzo's <i>Asterix and Son</i> and <i>Asterix and the Black Gold</i>.<p>Gr. 4-8. The comic-book alternate history adventures of Asterix and his buddy Obelix, begun in France in 1961, has continued through 31 volumes. These books (from 1983, 1981, and 1980, respectively) are new to American publication, though they have been available in Britain. Each story is filled with broad physical humor and puns that work in English as well as in the original French, and virtually no indigenous or ethnic group escapes Uderzo's wit (at one point, the heroes are invited to bed down in a Bethlehem cowshed.). In <i>Asterix and Son,</i> Asterix and Obelix become guardians of a kidnapped baby who takes a potion and develops superhuman strength. In <i>Black Gold</i>, the heroes travel to Mesopotamia in search of more potion. In the <i>Great Divide,</i> competition between two village chieftains gives the Romans an opportunity to conquer. The cartoons are playfully round and brightly colored, and the architectural and martial details go beyond simple stereotypes. Asterix already has lots of fans; here are three new-to-America episodes that will please devotees as well as gather uninitiated readers with their mix of humor, history, and good storytelling. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The halcyon visit sparked a deep friendship and a lifelong exchange of highly entertaining correspondence. When something caught their interest and they knew the other would be amused, they sent off a letter&#x2014;there are glimpses of President Kennedy&#x2019;s inauguration, weekends at Sandringham, filming with Errol Flynn, the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, and, above all, life at Chatsworth, the great house that Debo spent much of her life restoring, and of Paddy in the house that he and his wife designed and built on the southernmost peninsula of Greece.<br><br> There rarely have been such contrasting styles: Debo&#x2014;smart, idiosyncratic, and funny&#x2014;darts from subject to subject, dashing off letters in her breezy, spontaneous style. Paddy, the polygot and widely read virtuoso, replies in the fluent polished manner that has earned him recognition as one of the finest writers in the English language.<br><br> As editor Charlotte Mosley writes, &#x201c;Much of the charm of the letters lies in their authors&#x2019; particular outlook on life. Both are acutely observant and clear-sighted about human failings, but their lack of cynicism and gift for looking on the bright side bear out the maxim that the world tends to treat you as you find it. On the whole, the people they meet are good to them, the places they visit enchant them, and they succeed splendidly in all they set out to do. This lightheartedness&#x2014;a trait that attracted many, often less sunny, people towards them&#x2014;gives their letters an irresistible fizz and sparkle.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Patrick Leigh Fermor</b> (1915-2011) was an intrepid traveler, a heroic soldier, and a writer with a unique prose style. After his stormy schooldays, followed by the walk across Europe to Constantinople that begins in <i>A Time of Gifts</i> (1977) and continues through <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i> (1986), he lived and traveled in the Balkans and the Greek Archipelago. His books <i>Mani</i> (1958) and <i>Roumeli</i> (1966) attest to his deep interest in languages and remote places. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, and fought in Greece and Crete. He was awarded the DSO and OBE. He lived partly in Greece&#x2014;in the house he designed with his wife, Joan, in an olive grove in the Mani&#x2014;and partly in Worcestershire. He was knighted in 2004 for his services to literature and to British&#x2013;Greek relations. <br><b><br> The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire</b> (1920-1914) was the youngest of the six noted Mitford sisters. She became chatelaine and housekeeper of one of England&#x2019;s greatest and best-loved houses, but following her husband Andrew&#x2019;s death in 2004, she moved to a village on the Chatsworth Estate, where she died. <br><br> <b>Charlotte Mosley</b> lives in Paris and has worked as a publisher and journalist. She is the editor of <i>Love from Nancy: The Letters of Nancy Mitford</i>, <i>The Letters of Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh</i>, and <i>The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters</i>."Spanning 1954 to 2007, the volume reads like an accidental memoir of a disappearing world stretching from the manor houses of the English aristocracy to the olive groves of Greece, its people and places rendered with a kind of care that&#x2019;s becoming scarce in our age of helter-skelter communication. At the same time, the book&#x2019;s title, a phrase deriving from Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s habit of dashing off messages &#x2018;with a foot in the stirrup,&#x2019; captures the vigor and bustle of the lives that nourished the correspondence....<i>In Tearing Haste</i> is engaging from start to finish. There isn&#x2019;t a dull letter among Charlotte Mosley&#x2019;s selections. Even her annotations, often incorporating information from the book&#x2019;s two correspondents, are as surprising as they are informative....More than anything else, the collection is important as an addition to Leigh Fermor&#x2019;s body of work, both because his letters constitute a larger portion of the volume and because the writing in them harmonizes with the books that established his literary reputation." &#x2014;<i>The Nation</i> <br><br> "This is a book that evokes a lost world of glamour, intelligence and personal scruples.

Reprint.</p><p>Tamar Myers, who is of Mennonite background, is the author of the Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries and the Den of Antiquity series. Born and raised in the Congo, she lives in North Carolina.This debut mystery introduces Magdalena Yoder, a mean-spirited Mennonite innkeeper who offers service with a sneer to the "well-heeled, highfalutin customers" patronizing her PennDutch Inn in southern Pennsylvania. When not badmouthing her sinful, slothful, divorced sister and her "bizarre excuse for a dog," Magdalena attends to an unfortunate combination of guests: a congressman, his wife and aide, who are in the area for the first weekend of deer-hunting season; a quartet of anti-hunting activists; and Heather Brown, who calls herself a "photo-hunter." Ironically, one of the hunting foes bags the first big game when, in the middle of the night, he finds Heather sprawled dead on the inn stairs. Police chief Jeff Myers initiates an investigation of the suspicious death, but leaves soon for a vacation with his wife Tammy, who is, Magdalena's observes, "dingier than a mailbox on a gravel road." With the case in the hands of a dim deputy, Magdalena undertakes some sleuthing and learns that her patrons are secretly linked in their pasts. Another guest bites the dust as this carping narrator fails to display the high IQ she brags of: matters become clear to her only when the villain is overcome by a desire to confess. Occasional recipes, rich in butter and sugar, don't make up for the story's sour tone. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sworn to Silence: A Kate Burkholder Novel</h2><p><p>Now the subject of the Lifetime original movie <i>An Amish Murder</i></p><br><br><p><i>Sworn to Silence</i> is the first in Linda Castillo's <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Kate Burkholder series<i>.</i></p><p><i>Some secrets are too terrible to reveal.

Banks pulled the car onto the shoulder and flipped on the spotlight, running the beam along the edge of the field where corn stalks shivered in the cold. Twenty yards away, six Jersey cows stood in the bar ditch, chewing their cud.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows," he muttered. Besides chickens, they had to be the dumbest animals on earth.</p><p>He hit the radio. "Dispatch, this is forty-seven."</p><p>"What's up, T.J.?" asked Mona, the night dispatcher.</p><p>"I got a 10-54. Stutz's damn cows are out again."</p><p>"That's the second time in a week."</p><p>"Always on my shift, too."</p><p>"So what are you going to do? He ain't got no phone out there."</p><p>A glance at the clock on the dash told him it was nearly two A.M. "Well, I'm not going to stand out here in the frickin' cold and round up these stupid shits."</p><p>"Maybe you ought to just shoot 'em."</p><p>"Don't tempt me." Looking around, he sighed. Livestock on the road at this hour was an accident waiting to happen. If someone came around the curve too fast it could be bad. He thought of all the paperwork an accident would entail and shook his head. "I'll set up some flares then go drag his Amish ass out of bed."</p><p>"Let me know if you need backup." She snickered.</p><p>Yanking the zipper of his coat up to his chin, he slid his flashlight from its nest beside the seat and got out of the cruiser. It was so cold he could feel his nose hairs freezing. His boots crunched through snow as he made his way to the bar ditch, his breaths puffing out in front of him. He hated the graveyard shift almost as much as he hated winter.</p><p>He ran the flashlight beam along the fence line. Sure enough, twenty feet away two strands of barbed wire had come loose from a gnarled locust-wood post. Hoofprints told him several head had discovered the opening and ventured onto the shoulder for some illicit grazing.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows."</p><p>T.J. went back to the cruiser and popped the trunk. Removing two flares, he set them up on the centerline to warn traffic. He was on his way back to the cruiser when he spotted something in the snow on the opposite side of the road. Curious, he crossed to it. A solitary woman's shoe lay on the shoulder. Judging from its condition and lack of snow cover, it hadn't been there long. Teenagers, probably. This deserted stretch of road was a favorite place to smoke dope and have sex. They were almost as stupid as cows.</p><p>Frowning, T.J. nudged the shoe with his foot. That was when he noticed the drag marks, as if something heavy had been hauled through the snow. He traced the path with the flashlight beam, tracking it to the fence and into the field beyond. The hairs at the back of his neck prickled when he spotted blood. A lot of it.</p><p>"What the hell?"</p><p>He followed the trail into the ditch where yellow grass poked up through the snow. He climbed the fence and found more blood on the other side, stark and black against pristine white. It was enough to give a guy the willies.</p><p>The path took him to a stand of bare-branched hedge apple trees at the edge of a cornfield. He could hear himself breathing hard, the dead corn stalks whispering all around. T.J. set his hand on his revolver and swept the beam in a 360-degree circle. That was when he noticed the object in the snow.</p><p>At first he thought an animal had been hit and dragged itself there to die. But as he neared, the beam revealed something else. Pale flesh. A shock of darkish hair. A bare foot sticking out of the snow. Adrenaline kicked hard in his gut. "Holy shit."</p><p>For an instant he couldn't move. He couldn't stop looking at the dark circle of blood and colorless flesh. Giving himself a hard mental shake, T.J. dropped to his knees beside the body. His first thought was that she might still be alive. Brushing at the snow, he set his hand against a bare shoulder. Her skin was ice cold, but he rolled her over anyway. He saw more blood and pasty flesh and glazed eyes that seemed to stare right at him.</p><p>Shaken, he scrambled back. His hand trembled as he grappled for his lapel mike. "Dispatch! This is forty-seven!"</p><p>"What now, T.J? One of them cows chase you up a tree?"</p><p>"I got a fuckin' body here at Stutz's place."</p><p><i>"What?"</i></p><p>They used the ten-code system in Painters Mill, but for the life of him he couldn't remember the number for a dead body. He'd never had to use it. "I said I got a dead body."</p><p>"I heard you the first time." But the words were followed by a stunned pause as realization hit her. "What's your twenty?"</p><p>"Dog Leg Road, just south of the covered bridge."</p><p>A beat of silence. "Who is it?"</p><p>Everyone knew everyone in Painters Mill, but he'd never seen this woman before. "I don't know. A woman. Naked as the day she came into this world and deader than Elvis."</p><p>"A wreck or what?"</p><p>"This was no accident."

Beginning with genealogies of Vermont&#39;s rural poor in the 1920s, and concluding in the 1930s with an expos� of ethnic prejudice in Vermont&#39;s largest city, this story of the Eugenics Survey of Vermont explores the scope, limits, and changing interpretations of eugenics in America and offers a new approach to the history of progressive politics and social reform in New England. Inspired and directed by Zoology Professor Henry F. Perkins, the survey, through social research, political agitation, and education campaigns, infused eugenic agendas into progressive programs for child welfare, mental health, and rural community development. Breeding Better Vermonters examines social, ethnic, and religious tensions and reveals how population studies, theories of human heredity, and a rhetoric of altruism became subtle, yet powerful tools of social control and exclusion in a state whose motto was &#34;freedom and unity.&#34;</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 13 illus. 6 figs.

Now, with <i>Joie de Vivre: Simple French Style for Everyday Living,</i> an inspired fusion of art, style, and easy-to-implement ideas, anyone can feel like they spent a weekend in the French countryside, no matter where they live.<br><br>Renowned restaurateur Robert Arbor puts a refreshing emphasis on simplicity and accessibility, explaining the rituals and traditions that comprise a typical French day. Featuring dozens of simple, everyday recipes, <i>Joie de Vivre</i> captures the family meals, market trips, and charming domestic settings that make the French way of life so plea- surable. In eight chapters, illustrated with 85 full-color and black-and-white photographs, Arbor details how you, too, can achieve the simplicity and relaxing life the French treasure.<br> <br><i>Le Matin</i> (The Morning) lays out the elements of a relaxing breakfast (as well as the secret to great coffee), and <i>Le Potager</i> (The Garden) describes the pleasures and rewards of growing your own own vegetables, herbs, and flowers. <i>Le March�</i> (The Market) and <i>Le D�jeuner</i> (Lunchtime) follow Arbor to the market, the butcher, and the baker before serving up a trove of delicious ideas for light lunches and snacks. Le D�ner (Supper) outlines strategies for crafting cozy family dinners; creating enchanting dinner parties of all sizes; and preparing fun, simple meals for children.<br> <br>Arbor's memories and experiences of growing up in France and his flair for casual elegance can't help but inspire the chef and decorator in everyone.<br> <br>Sidebars sprinkled throughout the book offer tips and insights on how to make the perfect cup of hot chocolate, a French perspective on truffles and foie gras, the French and their love of chocolate, and why French butter tastes so good.<br> <br><i>Joie de Vivre</i> is a lavishly illustrated guide to the French style of living that will show you how to bring a little <i>joie</i> to your life.</p><p>In <i>Joie de Vivre</i>, Robert Arbor, a Frenchman transplanted to New York City, explains the French philosophy on life and argues for its adoption by stressed Americans. In a funny way, this is sort of a self-help book for people who admire the French lifestyle, and for those who believe that good food is the secret to a happy life. The premise of the book is that you will find "domestic happiness" when you learn to enjoy the most mundane details of your everyday life: "It's about making time for family, growing some vegetables in your garden, chatting with the butcher, and cooking for your family and friends." Quality of life, explains Arbor, is only improved when your pillowcases smell like lavender, and you make your own hot chocolate.<p> Although there are 50 recipes dispersed throughout the book, <i>Joie de Vivre</i> is not a cookbook. Most of the recipes are for dishes like A Really Good Fried Egg, mayonnaise, and caf� au lait, but there are interesting as well, such as Carrot R�p�e, Beet Vinaigrette, and Fish in Papillotte. The recipes are included more as a way to better describe the French experience and to show how easy it is to adopt as a way of life; a method which works particularly well for those of us who know that the best way to understand and appreciate a foreign culture is through its food. <i>--Leora Y.

By day, he works his crooked car lot with much success.

Connell, long recognized as one of the most important literary voices of American letters, is the author of seventeen books, including <i>Mrs. Bridge</i>, the best-selling <i>Son of the Morning Star</i>, and <i>Deus Lo Volt! </i> He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.HThese 20 erudite and entertaining historical essays (all but three of which have appeared in previous volumes) highlight Connell's wide-ranging intellect and lucid prose. He revels in unexpected turns of fate and relishes the picturesque, strangely compelling details that historians often miss. Interweaving exhaustive scholarship with winning humor in an essay on astronomy, he recounts how the arrogant Tycho Brahe lost the bridge of his nose during a duel with a rival scientist over "which of them was the better mathematician." A few pieces consider historic clashes between "those traditional opponents Science and Religion." Fascinated by people who probe the outer limits of knowledge and geography, Connell provides a blow-by-blow account of the famous debate between Thomas Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce over evolution and describes the searing conflict between Galileo and the Catholic Church over heliocentrism. "White Lantern" the best essay of the bunch passionately (even enviously) details the amazing race to the South Pole between pragmatic Norwegian Roald Amundsen and romantic Englishman Captain Robert Scott, in a narrative even Jon Krakauer would admire. Connell sagely points out that "Amundsen, the victor, is not as renowned as the loser," because a dead hero (Scott died on the return trip) is more likely to captivate the public's imagination. Confessing a hopeless attraction to "buried treasure, monsters, ghosts, derelict ships, inexplicable footprints, and luminous objects streaking through the sky," Connell chronicles journeys of absolute, disastrous futility the searches for Atlantis, the Seven Cities of Gold and the Northwest Passage. These skillfully crafted essays will please any history, science or adventure buff. (Sept. 30)Forecast: Connell's Sun of the Morning Star: Custer and the Little Bighorn was a much-praised bestseller.

Tiny blue halos winked into existence and<br>slowly swelled into the backlit rectangles of enormous cargo barges returning with loads of<br>durasteel from outlying fabrication plants. Crew transports laced the darkness with long tails of ions, racing from<br>task to task on more than a hundred orbiting dry docks, and<br>enormous welding droids traced ship skeletons in brilliant<br>spark storms.<br><br>On the way in, Han Solo had counted nearly five hundred war-ships under<br>construction in the old Bilbringi Shipyards. They were mostly escorts,<br>corvettes, and other small stuff that could be finished in a hurry, but<br>there were also two Imperial-class Star Destroyers. While these huge<br>ships probably would not be ready before the Yuuzhan Vong captured the<br>facility, the hulls were nearly closed and the drive units already<br>mounted. Clearly, young General Muun was a Sullustan with a plan, just<br>the sort of careful deskpilot who always impressed Coruscant Command&#x2014;and<br>seldom failed to exhaust Han&#x2019;s limited supply of patience.<br><br>Wishing he could use one of those Jedi calming techniques his son Jacen<br>was always talking about, Han forced an insincere smile and turned<br>toward the center of the room. Leia sat on a small couch with the<br>general, her face glowing with the same stunning brown-eyed intensity<br>that had caught Han&#x2019;s eye so long ago. Though he would never understand<br>how she had kept that fervor burning so brightly through thirty years of<br>service to the galaxy, it had become a mooring for him, the one constant<br>that never seemed to change through so many decades of struggle, loss,<br>and death. Now, when occasionally her legs&#x2014;healed from her near-fatal<br>ordeal on Duro but still sometimes weak&#x2014;tired and stumbled, the pain of<br>almost losing her made his heart stop, and he swore he would never, ever<br>shut her out again.<br><br>". . . hundred thousand lives are at stake, General," she was saying.<br>"The Vray are a gentle species. Without an escort, the evacuation convoy<br>will be defenseless against the Yuuzhan Vong."<br><br>"And how many lives will the New Republic lose if Bilbringi falls before<br>the fleet is completed?" Muun asked. His heavy Sul-lustan jowls rippled<br>gently as he spoke, but his feelings remained otherwise hidden behind<br>his flat mask of a face. "Whole worlds will perish, and that will mean<br>millions."<br><br>"She&#x2019;s only asking for twenty ships," Han said.<br><br>The general turned his black eyes on Han. "She is asking for five<br>cruisers and fifteen corvettes&#x2014;a quarter of Bilbringi&#x2019;s defense, and the<br>Yuuzhan Vong are already probing our outer security posts." "We&#x2019;re<br>letting you keep the Dauntless." Han spoke in his most reasonable tone.<br>"And the other ships will be back in a week stan-dard. . . two, tops."<br><br>"I am sorry, no." Muun shook his head and started to rise.<br><br>A buzz sounded from the secure comm station on the general&#x2019;s desk.<br>C-3PO, who had been standing behind the couch, raised his head and<br>inquired, "Would you like me to take that for you, General?"<br><br>Muun nodded. "Unless it&#x2019;s urgent priority, I&#x2019;ll reply in a few minutes."<br><br>"Thanks, Threepio," Han said. Any interruption would only reduce their<br>chances of getting the escort. He dropped into a seat opposite Muun.<br>"You seem to be forgetting who you&#x2019;re talking to, General."<br><br>Leia&#x2019;s brown eyes flashed in alarm. "Han&#x2014;"<br><br>"It wasn&#x2019;t so long ago she could have demanded the ships," Han<br>continued. "If anyone deserves&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know what the Princess deserves." Muun reluctantly re-turned to his<br>seat. "I studied the history vids at the academy."<br><br>"History vids?" Han growled. "So they activated you when? About last<br>year?" He glanced through the transparisteel dome at the bustling dry<br>docks. "You must have had some test scores to get a command like this."<br><br>An indignant shudder ran through the Sullustan&#x2019;s jowls, but before he<br>could reply, C-3PO spoke again.<br><br>"Excuse me for interrupting, but there is a Yuuzhan Vong emissary asking<br>to see Princess Leia."<br><br>"What?" Han and Leia asked together.<br><br>"Tell him no," Han said.<br><br>And Leia asked, "How did he find me?"<br><br>C-3PO spouted a millisecond of digital squeal into the comm station. The<br>reply came a moment later.<br><br>"The Yuuzhan Vong emissary refuses to reveal that information to the<br>picket officer, but he does swear in the name of Yun-Yammka to do you no<br>harm. He wishes to discuss the fate of some refugees."<br><br>"No," Han said.<br><br>to the Yuuzhan Vong, he was determined not to lose his wife. "Or maybe<br>you&#x2019;ve forgotten Elan and the bo&#x2019;tous attempt&#x2014;or how close you came to<br>losing your legs last year on Duro?"<br><br>"I haven&#x2019;t forgotten," Leia said evenly. She turned to their host. "But<br>I&#x2019;m sure General Muun wants to hear how the Yuuzhan Vong knew I was<br>here&#x2014;almost as much as I do."<br><br>The Sullustan nodded. "Indeed."<br><br>"You can&#x2019;t let a Yuuzhan Vong into Bilbringi!" Han said, realizing that<br>Muun was his best hope of preventing Leia from taking such a risk. "The<br>ship counts alone&#x2014;"<br><br>"Will be of use to our enemies only if they are accurate." The Sullustan<br>did not even look in Han&#x2019;s direction. His jowls lifted into a sort of<br>stiff grin, and he said to Leia, "We have been waiting for just such an<br>opportunity."<br><br>"Then it is my pleasure to give it to you." Leia turned to C-3PO. "You<br>may relay to the Yuuzhan Vong that we will grant him safe passage."<br><br>"As long as he presents himself unarmed and unmasked," Han added glumly.<br>Leia&#x2019;s Noghri bodyguards, waiting in the corridor outside Muun&#x2019;s office,<br>would like this even less than he did, but they stood no chance at all<br>of changing her mind. "And if there&#x2019;s any funny business&#x2014;" "He has<br>already promised honorable conduct," C-3PO replied. "Though, if you ask<br>me, a Yuuzhan Vong&#x2019;s promise is worth precisely as much as a Jawa&#x2019;s."<br><br>General Muun stepped over to his desk and opened a comm channel to his<br>security chief. "Commence Operation Restbreak. This is not a drill."<br><br>Han and the two bodyguards spent the next two hours converting one of<br>the base&#x2019;s old Imperial interrogation chambers into an interview room he<br>considered safe enough for his wife. The main safety feature was the<br>transparisteel panel through which the discussion would be held, but<br>there were also the biosensor arrays<br><br>Leia flashed him a scowl, then said to C-3PO, "Tell him I&#x2019;ll send<br>instructions shortly."<br><br>"Have you gone spacesick?" Han knew he would never win this argument,<br>but he had to try. Having already lost his best friend to monitor the<br>Yuuzhan Vong&#x2019;s body state, the negative air pressure to confine any<br>poisons he might release to the original room, and a "void button" that<br>would open the chamber to the near-vacuum outside.<br><br>General Muun&#x2019;s preparations were just as thorough and twice as fast. He<br>had barely given the order before the orbiting dry docks began to fall<br>dark and still, making the shipyard look more and more abandoned. By the<br>time the picket ship appeared above the planetoid, only three<br>dilapidated dry docks remained in operation, skeleton crews scurrying<br>about their work as though rushing to put the final touches on half a<br>dozen inconsequential corvettes. The vast majority of the dry docks were<br>not even visible, and the few that could be seen contained only<br>half-built craft that appeared to have been abandoned in the haste of an<br>over-early evacuation. Whether or not the general deserved his command<br>at such a young age, Han had to admire his cleverness; based on what<br>could be seen from the surface, the Yuuzhan Vong would be in no hurry to<br>attack the Bilbringi Shipyards.<br><br>C-3PO announced the emissary&#x2019;s arrival, then a dozen guards entered the<br>interrogation chamber with their charge. The Yuuzhan Vong had been<br>afforded few diplomatic courtesies; something that looked like an<br>artificial eye had been confiscated and now rested in a security<br>officer&#x2019;s hand, and in place of his own clothes, he wore a thin fleet<br>watchcloak with the hood up. In his hands he carried a spongelike<br>creature that resembled the villips Yuuzhan Vong used to communicate<br>over long distances, though this one was larger and more gelatinous. The<br>shipyard science officers had screened the creature for every known form<br>of Yuuzhan Vong attack and con-firmed it to be an organic communication<br>device, but Leia&#x2019;s Noghri bodyguards, Adarakh and Meewalh, insisted on<br>performing their own inspection, sniffing, prodding, and squeezing the<br>thing until Han thought it would burst. He put his hand over the void<br>button anyway; until someone could tell him how an overgrown proto- zoan<br>could send messages across the galaxy as efficiently as the HoloNet, he<br>wasn&#x2019;t taking anyone&#x2019;s word for anything.<br><br>Once everyone was satisfied, the escorts pushed the emissary into the<br>room&#x2019;s single chair, then left and locked the door.<br><br>Leia stepped to the transparisteel.

And it shows that reincarnation can be practical -- and very personal.</p><p><em>Return from Heaven</em> is not a religious or theoretical book. It is empirical, based on direct observation of very young children -- some as young as two and still in diapers. Its many true stories follow typical American families as they are convinced by their toddlers' statements and behaviors that the child is remembering the past life of a departed relative. Readers are witness to the parents' struggles to reconcile what they see coming from their own child with their prior belief that "reincarnation isn't possible." They share what it feels like -- the personal dilemmas and utter joy -- to have a close relationship with two incarnations of the same soul.</p><p>Author Carol Bowman is recognized as a pioneer in reincarnation studies. She began collecting cases in 1988 not as a researcher, but as a mother trying to understand the past-life memories of her own two children. She shared her discoveries in <em>Children's Past Lives</em>, the first book to explain in practical terms how to recognize and respond to a child's past-life memories. Then, in the hundreds of cases that came to her since its publication, Bowman noticed a high percentage in which the child had unmistakable memories of a recently deceased relative. <em>Return from Heaven</em> presents the best of these family-return cases, focusing on the profound emotions and realizations they stir in the parents and families.</p><p>With a foreword by world-renowned medium James Van Praagh (<em>Healing Grief),</em> these true stories hold powerful lessons for everyone, not just parents. Some give fresh insight into metaphysical questions, such as how we choose our parents. Others cast a new light on miscarriage and abortion. Common to all are the lessons that death is not the end of life, and that relationships continue despite death. <em>Return from Heaven</em> will enlighten and uplift readers with a very personal and fresh look at reincarnation, and with promise of reunion with beloved relatives.</p></p><p>Carol Bowman lives near Philadelphia with her husband; their two children are away in college. Through her writings, frequent lectures, and TV appearances on shows such as <em>Oprah, Good Morning America,</em> and <em>Unsolved Mysteries,</em> Bowman has opened the eyes of millions of parents to the fact that some children easily remember their past lives. She is recognized as a leading expert in this new field.<p>Bowman holds a master's degree in counseling and practices past-life-oriented counseling and therapy. She continues to promote research of children's past lives and same-family reincarnation.</p>After the publication of her last book, Children's Past Lives, Bowman was deluged with e-mails from readers wanting to share their stories. Many reported the rebirth of deceased relatives into their own families; Bowman, intrigued, set out to study the phenomenon, and she now presents her findings. Each tale is stranger than the next: a grandfather returned as a grandson, miscarried twins were transferred from their mother to her sister-in-law and were reborn years apart. Bowman admits she is not interested in "fretting about proof" for these unlikely scenarios, but the stories are gripping in and of themselves. It's testimony to their high drama that a book beginning with the truly weird and uncanny premise, "What if the child who [is] just like great-grandpa really is?" can, by the end, make it seem almost a shame not to have a returned uncle or two in the family. Bowman endeavors to present reincarnation as a whole worldview a cycle of living, dying and spiritual growth rather than the wishful thinking of bereaved hearts hoping to rob death of its finality. This book will not change anyone's mind: believers will believe, and skeptics will remain unconvinced. Bowman, a believer, gives too little credit to the virtuosic imagination of children (or for that matter adults). Undoubtedly, many readers will find comfort and meaning in her work, while others will enjoy it as a better ghost story than most. (Apr.)Forecast: Author appearances in L.A., D.C., and Chicago; a national media campaign; and a 50-city radio campaign should help this book find its audience. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Validation Breakthrough: Simple Techniques for Communicating with People with Alzheimer&#39;s-Type Dementia</h2><p>Cleveland, Ohio.

Initially on that account it was hard going for me (and I would image, for most people), but the book, wherein he presents an account of his solitary travels and tribulations during a period of nearly two years between 1876 and 1878, has long been widely regarded as a classic. It rewards persistence, and I found it quite spell-binding. Doughty was not without an ironic sense of humour as you can see from what he wrote about an Arab he encountered; &#34;...his strength lay in his stubborn brawns and large breast, and little in his brains which indeed were not very well settled.&#34; And something of his style as he wrote about pilgrams he fell in with on the way to Mecca: &#34;... peasants for the most part, as the richer and delicate livers are ever less zealous to seek hallows than poor bodies with small consolation in this world.&#34; Fantastic freaky style of Charles Doughty, May 29, 1998 By A Customer Convinced in the late 1800s that the English language had become hopelessly corrupt, Charles Doughty attempted in Arabia Deserta (and, less successfully, in his epic poems) to graft Victorian English onto Elizabethan syntax. The result was a beautiful, sometimes obscure, entirely original style that had a great deal of influence on the English modernists, particularly Henry Green.

But to most of us the man himself, his world, and his significance are all unknown. In this stunning historical narrative, John Man reveals the real Attila.<br> For a crucial twenty years in the early fifth century, Attila held the fate of the Roman Empire and the future of all Europe in his hands. The decaying imperium, dominating the West from its twin capitals of Rome and Constantinople, was threatened by barbarian tribes from the East. It was Attila who created the greatest of barbarian forces. His empire briefly rivaled Romes, reaching from the Rhine to the Black Sea, the Baltic to the Balkans. In numerous raids and three major campaigns against the Roman Empire, he earned himself an instant and undying reputation for savagery.<br> But there was more to him than mere barbarism. Attilas power derived from his astonishing character. He was capricious, arrogant, and brutal---but also brilliant enough to win the loyalty of millions. Huns thought him semi divine, Goths and other barbarians adored him, educated Westerners were proud to serve him. Attila was also a canny politician. From his base in the Hungarian grasslands, he sent Latin and Greek secretaries to blackmail the Roman Empire. Like other despots, before and since, he relied on foreign financial backing and knew how to play upon the weaknesses of his friends and enemies. With this unique blend of qualities, Attila very nearly dictated Europes future.<br> In the end, his ambitions ran away with him. An insane demand for the hand of a Roman princess and assaults too deep into France and Italy led to sudden death in the arms of a new wife. He did not live long enough to found a lasting empire--- but enough to jolt Rome toward its final fall.<br> In this riveting biography, John Man draws on his extensive travels through Attilas heartland and his experience with the nomadic traditions of Central Asia to reveal the man behind the myth.</p><p>is a historian and travel writer with a special interest in Mongolia.

With Hercules popular as both a live-action TV show and a Disney animated film, and teachers still giving out Greek and Roman mythology assignments, the answer is yes. This new one should be very helpful to both students and librarians. The author is a distinguished classicist at Oxford University, but her writing is accessible to general readers. The style is more modern than most mythology books, which enhances accessibility. Anglicisms do not interfere with an American's use of the book.<p>The book is in dictionary format with extensive cross-references. Roman names of gods refer the reader to the longer articles on the Greek gods. Where a Roman god was conflated with a Greek (e.g., Jupiter with Zeus or Juno with Hera), his or her distinctly Roman characteristics are described. Entries range from a couple of lines to several two-columned pages. Many of the entries have citations to Greek and Roman literary works, a number of which, such as <i>Iliad </i>and <i>Odyssey, </i>are easy to find in translation in inexpensive paperback editions. March also includes excerpts from the literature in her own translation. Her quotations from <i>Iliad</i> about the fate of Astyanax, Hector's little son, are surprisingly moving.</p><p>All of classical mythology's "usual suspects" (e.g., Apollo, Hercules, Trojan War) are included, with good, clear discussions. More obscure characters are also included, such as the men Cadmus created by sowing dragon's teeth. They are the Spartoi or Sown Men, and March has separate entries for each of them. Cross-referencing seems inconsistent. There is nothing in <i>Sown Men </i>to lead the reader to <i>Cadmus, </i>although there are links to <i>Pentheus, Teresias, </i>and several other entries.</p><p>At the end of the volume, March includes several appendixes: maps of the classical word, genealogies of gods and mythological families, thumbnail sketches of major classical authors, and a brief bibliography.

Devised in India in the 7th and 8th centuries and brought to North Africa by Muslim traders, the Hindu-Arabic system helped transform the West into the dominant force in science, technology, and commerce, leaving behind Muslim cultures which had long known it but had failed to see its potential.<br>The young Italian, Leonardo of Pisa (better known today as Fibonacci), had learned the Hindu number system when he traveled to North Africa with his father, a customs agent. The book he created was <i>Liber abbaci</i>, the "Book of Calculation," and the revolution that followed its publication was enormous. Arithmetic made it possible for ordinary people to buy and sell goods, convert currencies, and keep accurate records of possessions more readily than ever before. <i>Liber abbaci</i>'s publication led directly to large-scale international commerce and the scientific revolution of the Renaissance.<br>Yet despite the ubiquity of his discoveries, Leonardo of Pisa remains an enigma.

There are new discussions of social sin and Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s encyclical Caritas in Veritate, a clearer exploration of Jesus in the New Testament, and new study questions at the end of each chapter. &#39;Moral wisdom,&#39; as Fr. Keenan calls it, is the distinctive gift of the Catholic tradition, a gift that helps us discern what values to pursue and which virtues to embody on the path to becoming who we really are and who God calls us to be. Fr. Keenan uses a conversational style filled with stories and examples to open the treasure trove of resources in the Catholic tradition for developing moral wisdom. He lifts up the lessons on love, conscience, sin, and suffering, helping readers connect with the formative influences of the Catholic heritage and appreciate what gives meaning to our lives and what enhances our relationships with friends and family.</p><p>James Keenan, S.J., is Founders Professor of Theology at Boston College. He is the author of a number of books, including The Works of Mercy, Virtues for Ordinary Christians, and with Daniel Harrington, S.J., Jesus and Virtue Ethics.Keenan's book is sharp, offering constructively critical analyses of fundamental moral theological ideas with a profound respect for the Catholic tradition. Following the current trend in moral theology to use stories to internalize academic concepts, Keenan uses his own personal stories in ways that are more engaging than are many fictional stories. Readers identify well with his struggles with moral issues. Substantial revisions made for the new edition in the chapters on suffering, Jesus, and conscience make what was a great text even better. (Colonna, Dominic)<br><br>Praise for the first edition: Father James Keenan is one of those rare contemporary theologians who compellingly weave together rich pastoral experience and masterful intellectual inquiry. To read him is to hear not only the considered wisdom of Catholic moral teaching, but to have the privilege of hearing a learned man struggling to work out his own moral practices. In this book, lay readers and scholars alike can see how Catholic moral tradition informs a life of discernment, love, and everyday courage... (Tom Beaudoin)<br><br>Praise for the first edition: This is a lovely book! Keenan probes his own experiences of struggle, suffering and love, interweaving them with biblical reflection and theological analysis. He looks fault and sorrow squarely in the face, yet sustains buoyant notes of hope and commitment. The content of this book is an exercise in the virtue of its title.... (Cahill, Lisa Sowle)<br><br>Praise for the first edition: Imagine a book that is at once a source of profound wisdom, a systematic presentation of a moral and ethical tradition, and a 'page-turner!' This is what James Keenan's Moral Wisdom turns out to be. There is nothingfacile about this volume, nothing superficial, nothing manipulative. It weaves together autobiography, the stories of others, interpretation of biblical and theological texts, and a deep understanding of what morality is and what the Roman Catholic tradition of moral theology has been and can be when it is at its best. Few will come away from reading this book without imaginative new hope, salutary appreciation for 'hard sayings,' new insight into the meaning of divine mercy, and perhaps experiences of both laughter and the 'gift of tears.' Thought-provoking and informative, opening questions and not shutting them down: here is a significant contribution to ongoing explorations of the moral life.. (Margaret A. Farley)<br><br>James Keenan&#x2019;s gifts as story-teller and teacher have long awakened readers to the imagination&#x2019;s power to aid in their search for wisdom. My students have found his case quite compelling. This second edition of <i>Moral Wisdom</i> demonstrates his ability to synthesize an account of the historical quest for the good with a clear eye to the contemporary reader&#x2019;s journey. Keenan gets to the heart of debates about conscience in light of the person&#x2019;s search for the good and the right during this conflictive twenty-first century. He adds an incisive treatment of social sin that draws on films and an account of our history of racism in an effort to demonstrate society&#x2019;s power to blind us to evil. His chapter on 'Jesus in the New Testament' has been totally revised so that the reader moves directly into the scriptural texts themselves rather than through the interpretive frameworks of diverse scholars. Keenan&#x2019;s memorable chapter on suffering is sharper now in that he carefully integrates personal and biographical narratives with accounts from theology and the social sciences. This excellent edition should captivate its readers. (Gorman, Rosemarie E.)<br><br>Praise for the first edition: This is a lovely book!

(Tom Beaudoin)<br><br>Praise for the first edition: Moral wisdom is hard to come by because it is so complex. Most of us strive for moral wisdom throughout our lives but never totally attain it. In this book, James F. Keenan skillfully brings together deep theological knowledge, historical lessons, acute pastoral sensitivity, broad spiritual experiences, and true prudence in proposing moral wisdom for Christian life and spirituality today. (Charles E. Curran)<br><br>Praise for the first edition: A readable, uncommonly good book that should be required reading for anyone preparing for or engaged in pastoral ministry.

With their beautiful 3.75 square-island constantly in the media glare, Palm Beachers protect their impossibly rich society from outside scrutiny with vigilant police, ubiquitous personal security staffs, and screens of tall hedges encircling every mansion. </p><p>To this bizarre suspicious, exclusive world, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Ronald Kessler brought his charm, insight, and award-winning investigative skills, and came to know Palm Beach, its celebrated and powerful residents, and its exotic social rituals as no outside writer ever has. In this colorful, entertaining, and compulsively readable book. Kessler reveals the inside story of Palm Beach society as it moves languidly through the summer months, quickens in the fall, and shifts into frenetic high speed as the season begins in December, peaks in January and February, and continues into April. </p><p>When unimaginable wealth combines with unlimited leisure time oil an island barely three times the size of New York's Central Park, human foibles and desires, lust and greed, passion and avarice, become magnified and intensified. Like laboratory rats fed growth hormones, the 9,800 Palm Beach residents--87 percent of whom are millionaires--exhibit the most outlandish extremes of their breed. </p><p>To tell the story, Kessler follows four Palm Beachers through the season. These four characters--the reigning queen of Palm Beach society, the night manager of Palm Beach's trendiest bar, a gay "walker" who escorts wealthy women to balls, and a thirty--six-year-old gorgeous blonde who says she "can't find a guy in Palm Beach"--know practically everyone on the island and tell what goes on behind the scenes.</p><p>Interweaving the yarns of these unfor-gettable figures with the lifestyle, history, scandals, lore, and rituals of a unique island of excess, <em>The Season</em> creates a powerful, seamless, juicy narrative that no novelist could dream up.</p></p><p>In books such as <i>The FBI</i> and <i>Inside Congress</i>, Ronald Kessler turned his journalist's eye, its focus honed during years at <i>The Washington Post</i>, to uncovering the scandals behind America's biggest institutions; his research even led to the deposition of a director of the FBI. So, what secrets has he uncovered that will change the lives of Palm Beach denizens? Not many, as it turns out. Mistresses, breast implants, and other high-living extravagances of the Palm Beach rich aren't secrets after all. Nor does Kessler have the literary gifts of John Berendt, who deftly explored small-town society intrigue in <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>. The characters that populate <i>The Season</i> are straight out of <i>Dynasty</i>: "shapely" and "alluring," "raven-haired," or "spectacular blonds with impossibly tight behinds." If there's anything truly shocking about this book, it's witnessing Kessler's remarkable research skills put to such trivial use. As a frothy page-turner <i>The Season</i> earns its price, but as a cultural study it's as insubstantial as the lives it chronicles. <i>--Maria Dolan</i><p>Ronald Kessler is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Inside the White House, The FBI, Inside the CIA, The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded, Moscow Station,</em> and <em>The Richest Man in the World.</em> A former <em>Washington Post</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> investigative reporter, Kessler has won sixteen journalism awards, including two George Polk Awards.

This thematic distant cousin to "Beauty and the Beast" tells of two young beauties befriending a bear who is actually a prince under an evil spell. After they rescue an ungrateful dwarf three times, the girls witness the bear's assault on the dwarf and the prince's release from the spell. Cause and effect is a bit shaky in this tale, but the picture book is true to the Grimms. Unlike Snow White &amp; Rose Red illustrated by Gennady Spirin (Philomel, 1992), this simplified retelling eliminates the Grimms' religious undertones. The smooth text, marred a bit by some careless grammar, is the basis for the illustrator's large oil paintings enhanced by pictorial grace notes on the text pages. Sanderson's strength lies in architecture and landscapes. The human beings, carefully and skillfully drawn from life, often seem stiff and out of place in their environments. The most successful beings here are the two sisters, sturdy little girls with a sweet energy, and the dwarf who is satisfyingly nasty. The language is too sophisticated for beginning readers, but the pictures give a solidity to this slight tale that makes it enjoyable for young listeners.?Sally Margolis, formerly at Deerfield Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 6^-8. Sisters and best friends Snow White and Rose Red have an enchanted forest in which to play and a variety of woodland creatures with whom to play. This faithful retelling of an original Grimm folktale is enhanced by Sanderson's rich oil paintings. The girls and their mother are appealingly realistic characters, who have unusually friendly relationships with animals, which is important, since there are no other humans in the story. Drama and suspense come into the story with the sudden appearance of an enormous talking bear, who is soon befriended by the family. Evil is introduced into the girls' lives in the guise of the greedy, grouchy dwarf. Young readers may be unfamiliar with this story but will enjoy the action as the sisters rescue the dwarf three times before he comes to a bad end. The protagonists grow up and proceed to find happiness in this traditionally told tale. <i>Karen Morgan</i></p><h2>The secret word is Groucho</h2><p>Physical description; 217 p. ; 22 cm.

He was not just the famously cold, ironic analyst of ruthless power politics, evident in much of his most famous work, The Prince; he had a fervent sense of the common good and how that might be achieved in a republic. For him, Florence had the potential to be one of the greatest of republics, a match for ancient Rome itself, but that potential had never been fulfilled. In the Florentine Histories Machiavelli explores why not and in the process reveals the dynamic and danger of republican politics -- his thinking here, as in all his works, resonating powerfully for us today. The Florentine Histories is a series of eight essays (known as &#39;books&#39;) on the city and its Italian context during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. They do not follow all the rules of what we see today as professional historical writing -- Machiavelli could be as cavalier with the facts as an unscrupulous modern journalist -- but they are the fruit of one of the most original minds ever to have been brought to bear on politics.</p><p></p><h2>The Unidentified Redhead (The Redhead Series)</h2><p><b>The first in <i>USA TODAY</i> bestselling author Alice Clayton&#x2019;s Redhead series is a playful and erotic romance between an aspiring actress and Hollywood&#x2019;s hottest new leading man.</b><br><br><b>WATCH OUT, HOLLYWOOD! </b><br> <br>Grace Sheridan is back. Ten years after discovering that looks and talent are a dime a dozen in Los Angeles, she&#x2019;s wriggling into a pair of badass jeans and ready to show the film industry that there&#x2019;s way more to her than just a head of gorgeous red curls. And Hollywood&#x2019;s newest Brit super-hunk Jack Hamilton certainly sees a lot to like.

I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re ready for this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this an &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re ready for this jelly&#x2019; situation?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you actually just say that to a half-naked girl? Seriously, you should know better. You&#x2019;ll give me a complex. Asshead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re making this too hard, Grace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she said,&#x201d; I muttered, and laughed quietly to myself. I was in the process of trying to get my butt into a new pair of low-rise jeans that were so very, very low, they might have been illegal.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Holly announced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming in. Suck it in, Grace!&#x201d;<br> <br>She came barreling through the door, stopping short when she saw me struggling on the bed. I was laid out flat on the sheets in a charming lacy peach bra, halfway in and out of the damn jeans that she had convinced me to buy, even though I knew I was in no way young enough to work them in the way they deserved to be worked. Holly had always had a way of getting me to do things she wanted me to do, under the guise that she knew what was best for me. And, mother-of-pearl, she was almost always right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sweet rack,&#x201d; she said, acknowledging my bra. &#x201c;Do I need to get a pair of pliers and pull the zipper up myself? Didn&#x2019;t we see that done in a movie once?&#x201d; she mused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes we did . . . a little help? I&#x2019;m giving a full salute here. I&#x2019;d like to get the girls back under wraps,&#x201d; I answered, struggling to stay on the bed at this odd angle.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see that. Okay, hold your breath,&#x201d; she said, and grabbed the button of my jeans. I pulled with all my might as the zipper finally closed, leaving me breathless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holy Lord. I think my uterus just left. Yep, there she goes,&#x201d; I moaned.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t believe how tight these jeans were, although I was damn proud to be wearing them. A &#x201c;you go, girl&#x201d; thrill rolled through me, but it could have also been the lack of oxygen from the denim restricting my air supply.<br> <br>Holly helped me climb off the bed, and I turned to admire the way I looked in these badass jeans, thinking that maybe I could actually pull them off. I still caught myself examining the mirror at times and having to look twice to make sure it was really me.<br> <br>She saw me checking myself out and chuckled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking sassy there, my friend. I would totally fuck you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s charming, Holly. Thanks.&#x201d; I smiled back at her as I continued to pose in the mirror. I began to vogue and got to giggling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Grace, settle down. Vogueing is just wrong.&#x201d; She laughed, giving me one last thumbs-up as she left the room.<br> <br>I had recently shed quite a bit of weight. In fact, I was in better shape now than when I was in college. Holly was proud of me and made sure to tell me often.<br> <br>Holly Newman and I met in college. While we both majored in theater, she knew early on that she preferred the behind-the-scenes world, especially the business side, while I was a major drama queen. The entire time we were in school together, we made plans for when we would conquer the entertainment world. She would have her own agency and manage only the best talent, working with artists who shared a similar creative vision. I, however, had stars in my eyes and wanted to be famous, famous, goddamned famous.<br> <br>She made it out to the coast six months before I did, and when I finally got there, she was already working her way up as a junior agent at one of the major firms in town. She had a real knack for artist management, knowing when to be tough and when to coddle. She knew when to really fight for her artists and when to lay the groundwork for future projects. When I arrived, she got me a job temping in the agency, and I watched in awe as she maneuvered in what was still very much a man&#x2019;s world.<br> <br>With Holly&#x2019;s perfect golden hair, fantastic figure, and stylish sensibility, she was asked all the time why she was working behind the scenes rather than in front of the camera. The girl was a knockout. But she always laughed and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just not for me,&#x201d; and then worked harder than everyone else.<br> <br>I loved L.A. I&#x2019;d moved in with Holly, started taking acting classes, and worked at the agency with her, while waiting tables at night in a restaurant in Santa Monica. I really felt like I was living the Hollywood lifestyle I&#x2019;d been dreaming of since I could remember.<br> <br>After about six months, Holly convinced her boss that I should come in for a reading and be considered for representation. I was prepared, I read well, my headshots were flawless . . . and then I waited. And waited. And then waited some more. Finally, they agreed to take me on if Holly agreed to sign me personally as my sole representation.<br> <br>She began sending me out on auditions. I auditioned all over that town, and I was damn good. But so was everyone else.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t book a single job.<br> <br>What they don&#x2019;t tell you when you grow up in the Midwest, light-years away from L.A., is that when you move to Hollywood, everyone is the next Miss Hot Shit. We all think we&#x2019;re the prettiest, we all think we&#x2019;re special, we all think we are the only one who truly has what it takes. We all think our talent is genuine and true, we all think we have something to share with the world, and we all can&#x2019;t understand why we aren&#x2019;t booking jobs all the time.<br> <br>The thing is, in L.A., you can&#x2019;t just be a pretty face, because you can airbrush that. You can&#x2019;t just have a good bod, because everyone else is nipped and tucked in places you don&#x2019;t even want to dream of. You can&#x2019;t just giggle and toss your hair and be the punch line, because someone else already has that job sewn up.<br> <br>For all the people who move to L.A. each year, just as many leave, limping back to their hometowns like pretty little sad sacks, telling their &#x201c;I lived in California&#x201d; stories over cocktails with their old high school friends.<br> <br>I became one of those sad sacks&#x2014;I only lasted in Los Angeles for eighteen months. I limped away, feeling like a failure for the first time in my life. I let the city and the industry beat me.<br> <br>But now I was back. It had taken me ten years to make it back, and this time I wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere.<br> <br><br> <br>Holly was having a party at her house to celebrate the launch of her new management company and had invited her close friends and several of the actors and actresses she represented. She had recently left a very high-profile position with a major agency. A few of her clients had chosen to stay with the other agency, but she was so good at crafting a career, particularly with fresh new talent, that many had followed her.<br> <br>Since I&#x2019;d moved back to L.A., I&#x2019;d been staying with her at her house in the hills. She&#x2019;d done very well for herself and had a great house off Mulholland Drive with a view of the city below.<br> <br>Which brings us to the illegal jeans. As a thirty-three-year-old with some preexisting body image issues, I was trying to get into the mind-set I would need to navigate this party in this particular pair of jeans. I had matched the illegal jeans with a fairly conservative turquoise, cowl-neck tank top and slid my feet into some very nice peep-toe sling-backs. I had great toe cleavage.<br> <br>I was wearing my hair down, which I rarely do, but Holly had banned all my ponytail holders this evening. We had gone that afternoon to get our hair done, and my red hair was a mass of soft curls. That stylist really earned his money, and even I had to admit the curls were shampoo-commercial-worthy.<br> <br>The party was in full swing, and everyone was having a great time. Because Holly only took on talent she truly wanted to invest herself in, they became her close friends as well. They were always at the house, and her circle had become my circle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Grace, you can&#x2019;t be serious. Feldman is way hotter than Haim.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was deep in a discussion with Nick, a screenwriter whom Holly had known for years. He&#x2019;d become one of my friends and could always be counted on as a good wingman at a party. Tonight we were knee-deep in the dirty martinis. Extra dirty. He was waiting for an actor to arrive whom Holly had recently begun to represent, an actor who apparently was poised to be the next big thing. I had yet to meet him, although Nick had admitted he was, and I quote, &#x201c;yummy, scrumptious . . . a bit scruffy, but in a totally hot kind of way.&#x201d; Also, his British accent was &#x201c;lovely,&#x201d; &#x201c;to die for,&#x201d; and &#x201c;knock-me-down-and-fuck-me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I will admit that Corey Feldman was genius in Goonies, and even semicute in Stand by Me. But no one holds a candle to my Lucas.&#x201d; I was determined to win this round. We had recently gotten into a similar discussion about Steve Carell versus Ricky Gervais, and it didn&#x2019;t end well. Someone got scratched.<br> <br>I heard a snicker behind me and a British voice said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ve gotta give the edge to Haim, if only for getting to kiss Heather Graham.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned to acknowledge the obvious genius of the newcomer who knew License to Drive.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;re Super-Sexy Scientist Guy!&#x201d; I cried out, clapping my hands over my mouth as soon as I&#x2019;d said it.

Original and significant."--Patricia Waterman, University of South Florida</p><p>"The most detailed study that has been done on the history of American Beach. . . . A work of quality . . . very much welcomed."--Isiah J. Williams III, publisher and editor, <i>Jacksonville Advocate</i><br><br> In the only complete history of Florida&#x2019;s American Beach to date, Marsha Dean Phelts draws together personal interviews, photos, newspaper articles, memoirs, maps, and official documents to reconstruct the character and traditions of Amelia Island&#x2019;s 200-acre African American community. In its heyday, when other beaches grudgingly provided only limited access, black vacationers traveled as many as 1,000 miles down the east coast of the United States and hundreds of miles along the Gulf coast to a beachfront that welcomed their business.<br><br> Beginning in 1781 with the Samuel Harrison homestead on the southern end of Amelia Island, Phelts traces the birth of the community to General Sherman&#x2019;s Special Field Order No. 15, in which the Union granted many former Confederate coastal holdings, including Harrison&#x2019;s property, to former slaves. She then follows the lineage of the first African American families known to have settled in the area to descendants remaining there today, including those of Zephaniah Kingsley and his wife, Anna Jai.<br><br> Moving through the Jim Crow era, Phelts describes the development of American Beach&#x2019;s predecessors in the early 1900s. Finally, she provides the fullest account to date of the life and contributions of Abraham Lincoln Lewis, the wealthy African American businessman who in 1935, as president of the Afro-American Life Insurance Company, initiated the purchase and development of the tract of seashore known as American Beach. From Lewis&#x2019;s arrival on the scene, Phelts follows the community&#x2019;s sustained development and growth, highlighting landmarks like the Ocean-Vu-Inn and the Blue Palace and concluding with a stirring plea for the preservation of American Beach, which is currently threatened by encroaching development.<br><br> In a narrative full of firsthand accounts and "old-timer" stories, Phelts, who has vacationed at American Beach since she was four and now lives there, frequently adopts the style of an oral historian to paint what is ultimately a personal and intimate portrait of a community rich in heritage and culture.</p><br></p><p><p>A vivid recollection of a groundbreaking beach community</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This book is both distinctive and valuable as one of the relatively few books on African Americans in Florida and as one of the even smaller number of publications treating the subject of well-to-do blacks.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;An insider&#x2019;s account, which is remarkably candid about the strengths and weaknesses, triumphs and pitfalls, of the community.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Southern Quarterly</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a lively story of a place marked by community, sociability and food, where generations of families found an oasis from racism.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The vivid, personal story of American Beach, a coastal community on Amelia Island in northeastern Florida . . . blends oral history with never-before-collected documents dating back to the turn of the century, including photographs, historical records, and even recipes for such local favorites as Daddy Charlie&#x2019;s Jamaican Con Pollo.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Preservation</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;More than a study of African American recreation, the book provides insight into the self-sufficient African American communities that were commonplace in the days of Jim Crow and their ultimate decline after desegregation.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Alabama Review</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Marsha Dean Phelts uses facts, photographs, profiles, memories and recipes to tell a story as intimate as the epics we enjoy over pie and coffee.

From his Pefkakian ancestry to sending memos to the bus driver and creating the ultimate school stench with squid, Douglas's antics baffle his myopic parents, teachers and administrators at his new school. It comes as no surprise that the boy is recommended to the Twinkie Squad, an after-school counseling group. Formerly stigmatized as a bunch of "weirdos," the Squad bonds together under Douglas's daring leadership and forms an unlikely alliance that unwittingly turns them into the school's most fashionable secret club. The broad humor that runs through this farcical story seems occasionally farfetched and contrived; similarly, the characters remain stereotypes, their personalities never fully developed. In spite of these drawbacks, middle readers may well take to the members of this eccentric squad--and to their kid-pleasing antics. Korman's fans may also be reassured by the fact that Douglas and his cohorts find a place for themselves and prove that fitting in is an overrated idea. Ages 8-12. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 4-7-- The story of what happens when the school geek group becomes the hottest ticket in town. No one wants to be part of the Special Discussion Group, unaffectionately known as the Twinkie Squad, at Thaddeus G. Little Middle School. Its members are social outcasts--until Douglas Fairchild takes charge. A born leader and the son of an ambassador, Douglas is a politically correct sixth grader who spends most of his time reveling in, and writing the history of, his Pefkakian heritage. Through him, the Twinkie Squad becomes an exclusive social club whose antics lead to hilariously silly effects. A believable supporting cast enhances this confident coup, as the group pulls fast ones on the rest of the school, the administration, alumni, and even the U. S. Surgeon General. In the process of wreaking all of this havoc, the once shy Special Discussion Group members gain confidence and become friends. Readers will delight in their behavior and will relate to the Squad members. They may even want to form their own club. --Sharon Korbeck, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Treasures of Tibetan Art: The Collections of the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art</h2><p>"There is a real danger of the disappearance of the unique Tibetan culture. So at such a time, this kind of work is very, very useful, very helpful....I feel that I see part of a Tibetan antique collection, ancient Tibetan things."<br> So commented the fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, upon visiting the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art. Founded in 1945 by Jacques Marchais (the professional named adopted by the private collector Jacqueline Klauber), this well-known, yet infrequently visited museum designed in the fashion of a small mountain temple in the Himalayas, is nestled on a serene hillside on Staten Island, New York. Never able to visit Tibet herself, Jacques Marchais developed a fascination for the culture and art of Tibet in the 1930s and spent the rest of her life collecting objects of Tibetan origin. Today, in its fiftieth year, the museum holds over 1,200 pieces and is particularly strong in Tibetan Buddhist art from Tibet, Mongolia, and northern China dating from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. <br> <em>Treasures of Tibetan Art: The Collections of the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art</em>, is a unique catalog of the most important works from this renowned collection. Beautifully illustrated, with 190 photographs (including eighty-one full-color plates) this extraordinary volume makes much of the splendor of the museum's holdings available for the first time. The objects--selected for their aesthetic or technical quality, religious or historic significance, rarity, or representation of similar works in the museum's collection--are primarily examples of religious art from Tibet, China, Mongolia, and Nepal. They include decorative temple and secular pieces, as well as several contemporary works, and works from as early as the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The book represents a collaboration between Western and Tibetan scholars. Compiled by the museum's director and curator, Barbara Lipton, and Tibetan consultant Nima Dorjee Ragnubs, the pieces are arranged roughly according to traditional Tibetan sequence, beginning with the Shakyamuni Buddha, arhats, and other lamas; meditational deities or yidam; and buddhas and bodhisattvas. Later entries cover protector deities and guardian deities; ritual objects and musical instruments; and jewelry and decorative objects. Each entry gives the name of the deity in English or Sanskrit, and in Tibetan transliteration where appropriate; the medium in which the object was created; the dimensions; and the provenance, date, and approximate place of origin, if known. In a number of entries, associated legends and folk tales have been recounted, and religious, ethnographical, art-historical, and historical information is provided where relevant. In addition, interesting essays by Lipton and noted Tibetan scholar Donald Lopez, provide valuable information on the institution's history and the nature of Tibetan Buddhism. Together, these fascinating catalog entries and illuminating essays contribute much new information on Tibetan culture, iconography, history, and folklore, while the objects alone form a body of work that illustrates the diffusion of Tibetan art, culture, and religion into China and Mongolia.<br> Lavishly illustrated, <em>Treasures of Tibetan Art</em> highlights a remarkable collection of unique works of art, offering a fascinating glimpse into the richness of Tibetan culture.</p><p><br><strong>Barbara Lipton</strong>, an art historian, is director and curator of the Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art and author of a number of books, including <em>Survival: Life and Art of the Alaskan Eskimo</em> and <em>John Cotton Dana and the Newark Museum</em>. <strong>Nima Dorjee Ragnubs</strong> is a Tibetan scholar and native of Tibet.<br>"This catalog offers in-depth documentation and analysis of a little known but important collection of Tibetan art, especially notable for its rich variety of sculptures of many types of periods and styles. It makes a significant contribution to the growing body of resources concerning Tibetan<br>art."--Marylin Rhie, Smith College, co-author of Wisdom and Compassion</p><h2>The RDI Book: Forging New Pathways for Autism, Asperger&#39;s and PDD with the Relationship Development Intervention Program</h2><p>n a highly readable, carefully detailed manner, The RDI Book chronicles the integration of cutting-edge theory and powerful clinical tools resulting in a program that has provided new hope to thousands of families with an ASD child. Dr. Gutstein describes the process in which parents are empowered and carefully trained by skilled professional consultants, to guide the cognitive, social and emotional development of their children. Through the framework of a unique dynamic intelligence curriculum, children become motivated to seek out new challenges and overcome their fear of change. Based on over ten years of research, Dr. Gutstein honors the delicate choreography critical for children of all ages to grow into independent, emotionally connected, responsible adults. The RDI Book is a landmark publication demonstrating how every family can apply their inherent wisdom and courage to attain success.</p><p>Dr. Steven Gutstein earned his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Case Western Reserve University and conducted his Internship and Post-Doctoral work at Rutgers Medical School. Between 1979 and 1987, he served as an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas Medical School. During this tenure, Dr. Gutstein also served as the Director of Psychology for Texas Children s Hospital and Director of Family Therapy Training for the Baylor College of Medicine. Prior to focusing his efforts on remediating Autism Spectrum Disorders, Dr. Gutstein was recognized as a nationally renowned developer of innovative clinical programs for children and teens with high-risk conditions. In 1983, he received the largest grant ever awarded by the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health, to develop family-based intervention programs for severely suicidal youth. He has developed innovative, family-based programs for children with various medical conditions and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders. He has also developed school programs for children with problems related to Executive Functioning. Since 1995 Steve and his wife, Dr. Rachelle Sheely, have served as the co-directors of RDIconnect, in Houston, Texas, which provides training and support to thousands of professionals and families around the world. He is also the Director of the Relationship Development Research Institute and the Gilbert Hall School in Los Angeles, California.From our perspective, this book comes as a most welcome up-to-date overview of the thinking and practice of this original and potentially revolutionary therapeutic approach to intervention with families who have a child on the autism spectrum. In the RDI Book, Dr Steven Gutstein writes in a style that is admirably accessible and engaging but not at all simplistic, deeply thoughtful and academically informed but neither pretentious nor abstruse, and therapeutically illuminating (indeed inspiring) but nowhere prescriptive nor formulaic. He offers a vision of the interpersonal grounding for communication and mental development development that he relates to the functioning of our dynamic brains and moves with ease between an account of typical early development and a subtle yet powerful analysis of the difficulties faced, but also the opportunities presented, in fostering development among children with autism. Through the committed and rigorous application of developmental principles underpinning guided participation to forge new pathways for individuals on the autism spectrum, the author not only provides an invaluable guide to parents and other caregivers or professionals seeking to help affected children, but also enables us all to appreciate what autism really means. This is a wonderful and often moving book about a hugely significant approach to parent-led intervention for children with autism. R.Peter Hobson, Tavistock Professor of Developmental Psychopathology in the University of London. --Peter Hobson, Tavistock Professor of Developmental Psychology in the University of London<br><br>The major contribution of this book for working with people diagnosed with ASD is the focus on dynamic intelligence as distinct from static skills. The review of dynamic processes is well grounded in current research and clearly points to the promotion of quality of life and the building of family strengths and supports as the primary treatment goal. The book also integrates relationship development models showing the importance of co-regulation and bridging as dynamic processes that foster and sustain dynamically adaptive ways of relating to the world. Alan Fogel Department of Pscyhology University of Utah --Alan Fogel, Department of Pscyhology, University of Utah<br><br>It is a great work. I am pleased to see how RDI is maturing and becoming a theoretical and pratical approach. May things I like about the book: it describes social development in ways that every parent should understand; it focuses on the parents as the main therapists; the consultant role has expanded to include both hands-on help and help through the internet; the possibility for parents to send short clips of interactions with their child to the internet site, where they can be viewed by the therapist; the succinct and accurate presentation of the shortcomings of some of the ABA approaches. All in all a really great book.

Stalin is dead, and a violent regime is beginning to fracture-leaving behind a society where the police are the criminals, and the criminals are innocent. A secret speech composed by Stalin's successor Khrushchev is distributed to the entire nation. Its message: Stalin was a tyrant. Its promise: The Soviet Union will change.<br> Facing his own personal turmoil, former state security officer Leo Demidov is also struggling to change. The two young girls he and his wife Raisa adopted have yet to forgive him for his part in the death of their parents. They are not alone.

Someone transformed beyond recognition into the perfect model of vengeance.<br>From the streets of Moscow in the throes of political upheaval, to the Siberian gulags, and to the center of the Hungarian uprising in Budapest, THE SECRET SPEECH is a breathtaking, epic novel that confirms Tom Rob Smith as one of the most exciting new authors writing today.<br><br></p><p>Tom Rob Smith graduated from Cambridge University in 2001 and lives in London. His first novel, <i>Child 44</i>, was a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and an international publishing sensation. Among its many honors, <i>Child 44</i> won the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize.Smith&#39;s first novel, CHILD 44 (2008), was long-listed for the Booker Prize. This second novel in his planned trilogy continues the chilling drama of life in the Soviet Union just after Khrushchev&#39;s purge of Stalin in 1956. Protagonist Leo Demidov is an ex-security officer during a time when it is dangerous to have been one of Stalin&#39;s minions. Now working as a homicide detective, Demidov is being threatened by the wife of a Russian Orthodox priest, whom he was responsible for imprisoning in the old days. Now the priest&#39;s wife has every intention of killing Demidov&#39;s daughter if he does not get her husband released from the gulag. Dennis Boutsikaris&#39;s Russian accents are superb.

M.C. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</h2><p>The cuisine of India is as ancient as it is varied, and in this attractive, oversized volume, food expert A.K. Achaya captures the full range and history of the Indian diet, from prehistoric times to the modern era. An informative volume that boasts over 150 black-and-white illustrations (including line drawings, photographs, and maps) and 55 color photographs on 20 plates, <em>Indian Food</em> draws on archaeology, anthropology, literature, philology, and botany to cook up a smorgasbord of fascinating facts about this exotic fare. <br> Achaya begins with the earliest food preparations of paleolithic and neolithic times, the cooking of the Harappan people (archeological evidence suggests they may have eaten baked chapati--griddle-roasted wheat cakes--food still popular today). He covers the diet of the Aryans (using information found in their rich Vedic literature); examines regional cuisines, such as those of Karnataka, Hyderabad, Bengal, Gujarat, Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh; describes the customs, rituals, and beliefs observed by different communities and religious groups; and traces the gradual shift towards vegetarianism with the advent of Buddhism and Jainism. In thirty-three boxed sections, he takes the reader on various sidetrips, touching on the Indian use of Bhang (cannabis) and opium, the history of ice cream (ranging from Marco Polo to Dolly Madison), the use of natural grains as the basis of early weight systems (3 black mustard seeds equaled 1 white mustard seed; 6 white mustard seeds equaled 1 middle-sized barley corn), and the names of alcoholic drinks that appear in Sanskrit literature, ranging from pre-Aryan Sura (made from barley or rice flour) to Harahuraka (wine made from black grapes from Afghanistan). Achaya also discusses non-Indian foods, such as tapioca, which was an important commodity for trade in South America as far back as 3000 BC, and the potato, first domesticated near Lake Titicaca, sometime between 5000 and 2000 BC. Indeed, the book provides a wealth of historical information on food in general, revealing that coffee may have been first used in Ethiopia, that the coconut evolved 20 million years ago in New Guinea, that carrots were first domesticated in Afghanistan (where they were greenish colored and rich in anthocyanin), and that the word banana is of African origin and may be connected with the Arabic word <em>banan</em> (fingers or toes). <br> With illustrations ranging from neolithic cave paintings from Madhya Pradesh, to full color photographs of modern Indian foods, <em>Indian Food</em> offers a rich cornucopia of information on this flavorful and popular cuisine.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>K.T.

Sheriff&#39;s Deputy Dwight Bryant soon learns that her death was not a simple accident, and more lives may be lost unless he and Deborah can discover why she died.</p><p><b>MARGARET MARON</b> grew up in the country near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she and her artist husband returned to the farm that had been in her family for a hundred years, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, <i>Bootlegger's Daughter</i>, became a <i>Washington Post </i>bestseller that swept the major mystery awards for its year-winning the Edgar, Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity Awards for Best Novel-and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels <i>Up Jumps the Devil</i>, <i>Storm Track</i>, and <i>Three-Day Town</i> each also won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. Margaret is also the author of the Sigrid Harald series of detective novels. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the highest civilian honor the state bestows on its authors.

To find out more about her, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.As Christmas and their first anniversary approach, District Judge Deborah Knott and chief sheriff&#x2019;s deputy Major Dwight Bryant deal with three deaths in their Colleton County, North Carolina, community. First Mallory Johnson, the golden girl of her senior high-school class, dies after crashing her car on the way home from a party, just two months after two students died and another was crippled, also in a car crash. Days later, the two teenage, ne&#x2019;er-do-well Wentworth brothers are found shot to death. The community is especially shaken by Mallory&#x2019;s death, since the homecoming queen and cheerleader was known not to drink or do drugs (although neither was she Little Miss Perfect), but Dwight is diverted from that investigation by the murders. As Deborah and Dwight gather and share information from family and friends about both cases, they find connections to a decades-old death. Yet Deborah carries on her holiday routines, even having a breakthrough with a previously chilly sister-in-law. Maron&#x2019;s trademark warm humor and Deborah&#x2019;s and Dwight&#x2019;s loving kinfolk leaven the tragedy to make this sixteenth in the series another winning entry and a fine holiday mystery. --Michele Leber</p><h2>City of Jade (Mithgar)</h2><p>The myth of a lost city carved of precious jade has proven irresistible to many in Mithgar.

It was only the vast debts caused by his addiction to opium that encouraged his prolific writing career - he would wield his capable literacy in journalism, which helped him meet the amounts he owed to creditors. Although Quincey&#39;s compelling account of addiction was published in 1821, his use of opium would persist until late in life. His finances improved thanks to the his daughters helping administrate his limited funds.

Earlier works such as <i>The Engines of God</i> and <i>Ancient Shores</i> had a thoughtful, archeological-exploration bent, but with <i>Moonfall</i> he takes off the gloves to create a splashy, near-future science fiction thriller with a big cast of characters and a do-or-die attitude. At the center of the story is Charlie Haskell, the U.S. vice president, who in 2024--an election year--has arrived at the American Moonbase to cut the ribbon and declare it operational. But there's a problem, and it's a doozy: a "sun-grazer" comet, with immense mass and speed, is on a collision course with the moon. Haskell, with an eye to his public image, puts himself at the bottom of the evacuation list. But time grows critically short, and soon more than his political future is in jeopardy--broken chunks of moon will begin exploding outwards. If they reach Earth, some of the chunks are big enough to cause an extinction event. McDevitt pays attention to his science while revving the action, and the stakes couldn't be higher: Haskell's choices will decide who lives and who dies--if anyone survives at all. <i>--Blaise Selby</i>In five days, comet "Tomiko" will shatter the Moon. Huge chunks will rain down on Earth, causing continent-wide fires, killer storms, and tidal waved as tall as mountain ranges. <p>Five days to save a world. </p><p>Five nightmare days for the reluctant Russian rocket jockey entrusted with Earth's future; for the woman astronaut who may be the last human on the Moon; for the scientist who must deflect the "possums" (POSSible IMpactors) or witness the end of science itself. And for Vice President Charlie Haskell, the career politician who discovers unexpected reserves of courage and principle as he makes choices not only for himself and his country, but for all humankind. </p><p>"Moonfall" is McDevitt's masterpiece-- a heart-stopping drama of heroism and hope played out against the awesome spectacle of the darkest night in human history.</p></p><h2>The Island of Sea Women: A Novel (Wheeler Large Print Book)</h2><p>A new novel from Lisa See, the New York Times bestselling author of The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane, about female friendship and family secrets on a small Korean island.<br><br>Mi-ja and Young-sook, two girls living on the Korean island of Jeju, are best friends that come from very different backgrounds.

The Island of Sea Women is an epoch set over many decades, beginning during a period of Japanese colonialism in the 1930s and 1940s, followed by World War II, the Korean War and its aftermath, through the era of cell phones and wet suits for the women divers.

The passionate illustrated personal record reveals a new dimension in the complex persona of the Mexican artist. The journal, covering the years 1944-1954, contains Kahlo&#39;s thoughts, poems and dreams, and often chronicles her stormy relationship with her husband, Diego Rivera, one of Mexico&#39;s most famous artists. The 70 watercolour illustrations in the journal - some lively sketches and costume designs, others complete paintings - offer revelations about the artist and the creative process, and show that she often used the journal to work out pictorial ideas that later found their way into her larger canvases. The recurring theme of Kahlo&#39;s childhood and her dreams, her political sensiblities, and her obsession with Diego are all illuminated in poetic phrases and haunting images. The book includes an essay on Kahlo by Sarah M. Lowe.</p><p>Frida Kahlo, one of the most dynamic figures of 20th-century art, has very nearly become a saint, so legendary is her tumultuous and tragic life. While there is no dearth of books about Kahlo and her work, none are as poignantly revealing as this diary, which includes her own words and pictures. We find the genesis of some of her most famous paintings, her love letters and sketches of people she knew such as her husband, the Mexican mural painter Diego Rivera, and numerous studies for self- portraits. The most fascinating part of the book is the facsimile diary, reproduced here for the first time, with colour illustrations. It is accompanied by an English translation with explanatory commentaries.</p><h2>The Fante and the Transatlantic Slave Trade (Rochester Studies in African History and the Diaspora, 52)</h2><p>The history of Ghana attracts popular interest out of proportion to its small size and marginal importance to the global economy. Ghana is the land of Kwame Nkrumah and the Pan-Africanist movement of the 1960s; it has been a temporary home to famous African Americans like W. E. B. DuBois and Maya Angelou; and its Asante Kingdom and signature kente cloth-global symbols of African culture and pride-are well known. Ghana also attracts a continuous flow of international tourists because of two historical sites that are among the most notorious monuments of the transatlantic slave trade: Cape Coast and Elmina Castles. These looming structures are a vivid reminder of the horrific trade that gave birth to the black population of the Americas. The Fante and the Transatlantic Slave Trade/ explores the fascinating history of the transatlantic slave trade on Ghana&#39;s coast between 1700 and 1807. Here author Rebecca Shumway brings to life the survival experiences of southern Ghanaians as they became both victims of continuous violence and successful brokers of enslaved human beings. The era of the slave trade gave birth to a new culture in this part of West Africa, just as it was giving birth to new cultures across the Americas. The Fante and the Transatlantic Slave Trade pushes Asante scholarship to the forefront of African diaspora and Atlantic World studies by showing the integral role of Fante middlemen and transatlantic trade in the development of the Asante economy prior to 1807.

Both Keller and Lincoln have been covered in numerous biographies for young people (Sullivan's own Picturing Lincoln was published last fall), but these volumes are worthwhile. The short chapters, large print, simple vocabulary, straightforward narrative, and attractive illustrations, as well as the addition of the subjects' own words, make them fine choices for early-grade biographies.

Using personal experiences and stories that are at once amusing and instructive, the author covers principles such as observation in nature, windows of opportunity, creating plant habitat, benefits of diversity, rules of green thumb, soil, seeds, water, sun, trees, humans, and the forest community. The second half of the book covers background (going all the way back to the Neolithic!), growth cycles of plants, preparing the ground, the greenhouse and the shadehouse, compost, potting soils (extensive!), planting seeds (also extensive!), making cuttings, and caring for plants. There are 2 addendums. Addendum 1 covers production, processing, and curing of medicinal herb seed. Addendum 2 covers harvest and processing of medicinal herbs. The book is detailed and informative yet engaging and entertaining.</p><p>Richo was born in 1955 in Iowa City Iowa, the son of a caring mother and an accomplished physician. He was always fascinated by plants and especially seeds, and demonstrated from an early age an unusual talent for collecting and germinating diverse seeds. His professional work as an archaeologist in East Africa blossomed into a nascent ascent into ethnobotany. On his return to the United States in 1975 he and his wife, Mayche, and their fledgling family set up a homestead in a remote area of the coast mountains of Oregon. Here they delved into the art, science, and horticulture of growing diverse gardens of medicinal herbs. Richo has written extensively of these experiences in his book &#34;Making Plant Medicine&#34; and now continues the story in &#34;The Medicinal Herb Grower.&#34; His writing style is much like James Herriot (of veterinary fame) but of course he discusses herbs, not horses. The early gardens contained scores of species of plants that were unusual at the time, and later gardens contained hundreds of species. Eventually, Richo and his family produced gardens with over 1,000 species of medicinal herbs from all over the world, with extensive collections from america, china, south america, europe, the middle east, and east africa. Seeds and organically certified medicinal herb plants began to be distributed under the auspices of &#34;Horizon Herbs, LLC&#34; which eventually grew to be a major player in conservation of medicinal herbs, distributing millions of seed packets of viable, organic, hand-collected, open-pollinated, heriloom, and not gmo&#39;d seeds worldwide. Richo&#39;s second book &#34;Growing At-Risk Medicinal Herbs--Cultivation, Conservation and Ecology&#34; was well-received by numerous growers, farmers, medicine makers, and also by the conservation community. It provided detailed information on the cultivation of 20 native american medicinal herbs at danger of extinction, including extremely detailed information on propagation biology, cultivation techniques, processing and yields. In recent years, Richo has been travelling worldwide (e.g. Yunnan, Zanzibar) to collect medicinal herb plants, focusing on finding the native land races of common medicinal herbs. His findings are well documented on his website at horizonherbs.com, and he contributes as a guest lecturer at herb gatherings nationwide as well as Bastyr University. His daughter, Nadja, is an associate professor of chemistry at University of Greensboro in North Carolina, where she engages in medicinal plant research. His daughter, Sena, has now illustrated three books. His wife is an accomplished cellist and editor. His son is a well-known builder of large geodesic domes. He has three grandchildren--Jaiden, Naia, and Nova Rose.

Her experiences working as a doctor in villages around Egypt, witnessing prostitution, honour killings and sexual abuse, including female circumcision, drove her to give voice to this suffering. She goes on explore the causes of the situation through a discussion of the historical role of Arab women in religion and literature. Saadawi argues that the veil, polygamy and legal inequality are incompatible with the essence of Islam or any human faith. </p></p><p>Egyptian novelist, doctor and militant writer on Arab women's problems and their struggle for liberation, <b>Nawal el Saadawi </b>was born in the village of Kafr Tahla. Refusing to accept the limitations imposed by both religious and colonial oppression on most women of rural origin, she qualified as a doctor in 1955 and rose to become Egypt's Director of Public Health. Since she began to write over 30 years ago, her books have concentrated on women. In 1972, her first work of non fiction, <i>Women and Sex</i>, evoked the antagonism of highly placed political and theological authorities, and the Ministry of Health was pressurised into dismissing her. Under similar pressures she lost her post as Chief Editor of a health journal and as Assistant General Secretary in the Medical Association in Egypt. From 1973 to 1976 she worked on researching women and neurosis in the Ain Shams University's Faculty of Medicine; and from 1979 to 1980 she was the United Nations Advisor for the Women's Programme in Africa (ECA) and Middle East (ECWA). Later in 1980, as a culmination of the long war she had fought for Egyptian women's social and intellectual freedom, an activity that had closed all avenues of official jobs to her, she was imprisoned under the Sadat regime. She has since founded the Arab Women's Solidarity Association and devoted her time to being a writer, journalist and worldwide speaker on women's issues. With the publication by Zed Books in 1980 of <i>The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World</i>, English language readers were first introduced to the work of this major writer. Zed Books has also published four of her previous novels, <i>Woman at Point Zero</i> (1983), <i>God Dies by the Nile</i> (1985), <i>The Circling Song</i> (1989) and <i>Searching</i> (1991) as well as a collection of her non-fiction writings <i>The Nawal El Saadawi Reader</i> (1997).

Dr. Slattery combines Christian principles, her professional expertise as a psychologist, and personal experience as a wife in this indispensable book to help women improve their marriages.</p> <p>When expectations of trust and intimacy go unfulfilled, a wife's anger and fear can result in unhealthy domination and control. The power of a woman's approval and perspective in a relationship cannot be underestimated; it must be directed in ways that promote intimacy instead of destroying it.

Year after year, we have had the same old arguments. Now, we rarely even talk about our problems. It's almost as if we have settled for a cold war. No passion. No excitement. Certainly no intimacy.</i></p> <p><i>I always knew marriage wouldn't be perfect, but I expected it to be more fulfilling than this. John just doesn't seem to care anymore. He gets more excited about the latest football scores than he does about our relationship. He's more upset about losing a golf game than hurting my feelings. Even when he does something nice, I can tell he does it out of duty, not love. This isn't what marriage is supposed to be. I'm not sure I ever would have married had I known this is what I would get.</i></p> <p><i>Sometimes I am so angry with John. We seem just a couple steps away from happiness, but we never get there. Why can't he realize how insensitive he is to my needs? Why can't he value the marriage as much as I do? Sometimes I don't even feel like it's worth trying any more. Did I make a mistake when I married him? Is there any hope for us?</i></p> <p><i>�Kara</i></p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In my counseling practice, I hear far too many wives whose feelings would be expressed by this session with Kara. Hoping to find true love, they have found true frustration. Looking for happily ever after, they have endured enough disappointment to last a lifetime. Shattered dreams and unmet needs�what woman can't relate to them? With all that can be said of and for marriage, it rarely lives up to the dreams of many hopeful brides.</p> <p>Emily had dreamed of marriage since she was a little girl. Her parent's marriage had lasted a mere four years after Emily was born. Even as a young child, she remembered the arguments and the yelling. She could only imagine what it would be like to have a mom and dad who loved each other. Emily's hope for a loving family were soon invested in her dreams for intimacy and marriage. She wondered what kind of man she would marry and vowed that they would never be divorced.</p> <p>After Emily grew up, her dreams were no less vivid. The drawers of her desk at work were stuffed with bride's magazines and romance novels�symbols of her longing for the perfect marriage. She hoped that everything bad about her life would disappear in the face of a wonderful marriage. The loneliness and pain would melt away when she was enveloped in the unconditional love of her "hero."</p> <p>When Emily was twenty-five, her fantasy finally began to materialize. She met someone who appeared to be the man of her dreams. After a whirlwind courtship, the two were engaged with every hope of a match made in heaven. He seemed to complement her in every way, as his strengths compensated for her weaknesses. For awhile, her loneliness disappeared. Her fiancT seemed perfect, attentive to her thoughts and dreams.</p> <p>The long-awaited day finally arrived. Walking down the aisle, Emily looked more beautiful than even she had imagined. Her prince was breathtaking in his tuxedo, his eyes filled with hope. In the secret recesses of her heart, she hoped that maybe she had discovered the impossible�true love. Their family and friends waved good-bye as the newlyweds fled to a romantic honeymoon getaway.</p> <p>As the days and weeks of their new marriage wore on, the conflicts began to emerge. Emily's new husband was not nearly as attentive to her as he had been before they married. He spent hours in the garage, rebuilding an old car. Sometimes on Friday nights he went out with the guys after work and came home after midnight. Emily felt the first shock of disappointment as the luster on her prince's armor began to tarnish. How could she be married, yet still have the same feelings of loneliness she had fought all of these years? Not wanting to make her husband angry, she swallowed her hurt and did every thing she knew to do to keep peace in the marriage.</p> <p>By the time a year had passed, their marriage had become little more than a casual friendship. As Emily lay in bed one night, quietly sobbing into her pillow, she asked herself, "Did I marry the right person?" Every quality of her prince that had once reassured her now seemed to be collapsing into a heap of weaknesses. Panic seized her as she realized that her marriage was becoming just like that of her parents. Her fairy tale had evaporated.</p> <p>This example highlights the contrast between the romantic expectations of too many women and the reality of marriage. A nanve young woman like Emily, determined not to make the same mistakes her parents had made but not knowing how to avoid them, would seem destined for disappointment. Her expectations for her husband were unrealistic. She did not anticipate conflict, anger and trials to be a part of her marriage. She was naturally crushed when the feelings of love began to waver.</p> <p>But what about the older and more mature? Are they immune from unrealistic expectations and therefore more likely to be satisfied in marriage? Although they may be less surprised at the difficulty of marriage, older women are just as likely to be frustrated that their marriages are not more intimate.</p> <p>Becky and Gene were in their mid-thirties when they got married. Because they wed later in life, they had fairly realistic expectations of what marriage would be. They had dated for over two years and had a good handle on their respective strengths and limitations. They knew that their big disagreements would always be over the issues of in-laws and money. Becky and Gene were prepared for marriage. They had every reason to be optimistic about their union and trusted God to bless their new family.</p> <p>Becky came to me for counseling two years into the marriage. After only a few minutes she collapsed into tears. "I am beginning to realize that Gene is never going to change. He will always be obsessed with work and he will never understand that I need more from him! I can't imagine living our whole lives together feeling this lonely. The worst part is that he doesn't even notice anything is wrong!"</p> <p>Even if, like Becky, a woman thinks she is prepared for marriage, there will almost certainly come a point where she feels cheated. Something inside of her screams, "I deserve better than this!" Every thoughtless comment, forgotten birthday or sarcastic attitude reminds her of how broken her dream of fulfilling love seems to be. She wonders, "Is it my fault? Am I trying too hard or not hard enough? Why isn't this working the way it's supposed to?"</p> <p>Marriage has been described as "a romance in which the hero dies in the first chapter." Many women, like Emily and Becky, are deeply wounded to learn that their dream of "the prince" exists only in fantasy. They may look enviously at other marriages and idolize husbands who are not their own, concluding that they simply picked the wrong man. They flock to seminars and workshops that promise three-step solutions to happiness, thinking, "if only I kiss my frog, he will turn into a prince." Like Cinderella in her dirty work clothes, they hope, "Somewhere is a fairy godmother who can make me beautiful enough to be cherished." The fantasy lives on�and so does the letdown.</p> <p>Overcoming the disappointment of marriage is a tremendous obstacle to building true intimacy. Often our understanding of love and marriage is unrealistic and incorrect. When we confront the real-life work of marriage, including disagreements, arguments and failures, we feel as if we have missed out on what we were promised.</p> <p>Modern culture both influences our thinking and reflects our misconceptions about marriage. Think about much of the entertainment marketed for women, both young and old. Movies, television programs, cartoons and romance novels consistently tell a story of a woman searching for love. Finally, she finds "Mr. Right." The stories almost always end when the man and women proclaim their love, with a wedding or at least a kiss to solidify their commitment. The message is clear: find the prince and you will become a princess. His love will rescue you. You will live happily ever after. No wonder girls and women alike often have an inaccurate view of both marriage and lasting love.</p> <p>We recently took our two children to the magical land of Walt Disney World. At Cinderella's castle, we ate breakfast with many of the Disney characters. Cinderella and her handsome Prince Charming fluttered through the room. When they got to our table, I playfully asked them about the state of their marriage. Prince Charming looked lovingly into his bride's eyes, held her hands, and said, "We have been married for 50 years and are still madly in love." I asked, "What is your secret?" "Living in Walt Disney World!" the Prince replied. Of course! Cinderella and Prince Charming are frozen in time. They have not aged or faced the realities of life. For fifty years they have lived on their wedding day. In fact, they still wear the same clothes.</p> <p>On the surface, their marriage seems perfect. The problem is that there is nothing more than the surface. Imagine that it were possible to live every day in the ecstasy of intoxicating new love. Fifty years of it. Never a fight or disagreement because there is never an issue to discuss. What a shallow existence! There has to be more to love than Cinderella's castle every day for fifty years.</p> <p>Of course there is more to love. But it is never realized through escaping the reality of disappointment and conflict.</p> <p>Newspaperman and novelist Edgar Watson Howe once said, "Marriage is a good deal like a circus: There is not as much in it as is represented in the advertising." Over time, most wives learn to live with their broken dreams and unfulfilled expectations. They accept that princes and princesses are fairy tales for children. "Adults live in the real world, with real relationships," they tell themselves. "Intimacy is simply unrealistic." Those who refuse to accept this reality may flit from marriage to marriage, hoping someday to win the lottery of love. Very few choose to believe that God can work wonders right in the middle of their all-too-human marriage. Why does God allow us to experience such disappointment? Why did he give us desires for love and intimacy that are destined to lead to disappointment?</p> <p>One of the greatest mysteries of human relationships is the miracle that God is able to work through a man and a woman who follow his design for marriage. The dream of the fairy tale stems from desires that God <i>can</i> fulfill. Our longings for love and intimacy highlight our need for relationships that go beyond the scope of the "normal" marriage. It is only through dependence on God and obedience to his plan (which is sometimes difficult) that we can get a glimpse of what real intimacy and love are all about. We are likely to find that mature love bears little resemblance to the "tingles" often mistaken as intimacy.</p> <p>We long for intimacy, for the kind of love that believes and bears all things. We are starved for it. Although fairy tales and fantasies only serve to foster unrealistic hopes, the dream of intimacy is real and alive today. We live in homes, not castles, and there are no real dragons for our husbands to slay. But God has placed the yearning for intimacy in our hearts for a reason. He did not intend for us to be continually frustrated in our marriages. However, lasting intimacy does not develop based on the intoxication of new love.</p> <p>God's plan is that marriage is love in its infancy, not its maturity. Intimacy can only grow and develop over a lifetime of living together within the safety of a committed love. Working through conflicts and differences, weathering storms, admitting selfishness and anger are all the necessary difficulties that allow genuine intimacy to grow. Unfortunately, many couples believe that such disappointments signal the end of intimacy instead of the beginning. <i>But the fairy tale must end for the potential of true intimacy to begin.</i></p> <p>I once heard a pastor say at a wedding ceremony, "There are hard marriages and there are bad marriages." Indeed, marriage takes hard work. It does not happen as naturally as falling in love. It is only through the longing for meaningful intimacy that people are reminded to work, to trust, to believe and to hope. A wife's desire for something deeper is often the engine that drives the couple to seek fulfillment. However, if she allows her longing to turn into bitterness, she will contribute to the stifling loneliness she dreads.</p> <p>God has designed the mystery of intimacy to be achieved through two very imperfect humans. Couples exchanging their wedding vows are ordinary men and women who have normal weaknesses, vulnerabilities and insecurities�no matter how much they may wish to hide these inadequacies from each other. Both of them will soon learn the inevitability of disappointment. It is only through the acceptance of each other's faults that the love they dream of can begin to become a reality.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>A woman never marries the man of her dreams.</i></p> <p><i>She helps the man she marries to become the man of his dreams.</i></p> </blockquote> <p>One of my most enjoyable assignments as a counselor is working with engaged couples. Premarital counseling sometimes feels like what a doctor must experience when delivering a new baby. These young adults have not made any mistakes yet. Their lives together are a clean slate filled with possibility and potential. The most exciting aspect of premarital counseling is the passion that they feel for each other. Their eyes see nothing but the strength and promise of their love.</p> <p>Typically, I ask the future bride to discuss some concerns she has about her fiancT. More than once, a young woman has been unable to identify even one weakness of her future husband. Of course, her infatuation will not last. A day will soon come when this new bride will not have to think hard to pinpoint her husband's limitations.</p> <p>Before the wedding, a woman sees a bright hope in her fiancT. She may see glimpses of his sensitivity, his strength and his commitment. After the wedding, she inevitably sees his weaknesses. Her disappointment may initially feel like a crashing blow. It becomes painfully obvious to her that he cannot meet all of her needs. She can't believe how rude and insensitive he can be. Now she has a choice: to respond in anger to his weakness, or to invest with faith in his strength. For intimacy to grow, she must believe in his potential. She can invest in the real-life prince that lies hidden beneath his doubts and insecurities.</p> <p>The secret of intimacy in marriage is not finding a "hero" to be your husband, but finding the "hero" in your husband. This is a tremendous and difficult task, particularly when a wife's reaction to her disappointment has been resentment. God has given each woman the power to help her husband grow, over time, into the godly man that he can become. Unfortunately, many women are so devastated by what he is <i>not </i>today that they refuse to invest in the man he <i>could become </i>tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What a Real Hero Looks Like</p> <p>"Finding the <i>hero </i>in your husband. What does that mean?" There is a lot of talk today about what makes a hero. How does one become a hero? Through special talents or athletic prowess? Superhuman feats? Daring rescues? If these are the criteria, where is the "hero" in the average husband?</p> <p>The essence of heroics is the consistent choice to sacrifice for others.

In neither of these cases, biblical or patristic, do these scholars find support for the kind of "toleration" of civil marriages following divorce advocated by Cardinal Kasper. This book also examines the Eastern Orthodox practice of <i>oikonomia</i> (understood as "mercy" implying "toleration") in cases of remarriage after divorce and in the context of the vexed question of Eucharistic communion. It traces the centuries long history of Catholic resistance to this convention, revealing serious theological and canonical difficulties inherent in past and current Orthodox Church practice.</p><p>Thus, in the second part of the book, the authors argue in favor of retaining the theological and canonical rationale for the intrinsic connection between traditional Catholic doctrine and sacramental discipline concerning marriage and communion.</p><p>The various studies in this book lead to the conclusion that the Church&#x2019;s longstanding fidelity to the truth of marriage constitutes the irrevocable foundation of its merciful and loving response to the individual who is civilly divorced and remarried. The book therefore challenges the premise that traditional Catholic doctrine and contemporary pastoral practice are in contradiction.</p><p>"Because it is the task of the apostolic ministry to ensure that the Church remains in the truth of Christ and to lead her ever more deeply into that truth, pastors must promote the sense of faith in all the faithful, examine and authoritatively judge the genuineness of its expressions and educate the faithful in an ever more mature evangelical discernment." <b>- St. John Paul II</b>, <i>Familiaris Consortio</i></p>&nbsp;<p></p></p><p></p><h2>American Vernacular: Regional Influences in Architecture and Interior Design</h2><p>Surveys the regional styles of American architecture and interior design and discusses contemporary versions</p><p></p><h2>The Little House Treasury: Little House in the Big Woods / Little House on the Prairie / On the Banks of Plum Creek</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

If current negative trajectories remain, including growing climate destabilization, biodiversity loss, and economic inequality, an impending future of ecological collapse and societal destabilization will make "personal success" virtually meaningless.

How, for example, are triple spirals put into the stem of a wine glass or table tops inlaid with whole landscapes of semi-precious stones? This unique dictionary is devoted to the fascinating materials and techniques used in the decorative arts. Materials range from the exotic to the most basic, from rare stones found only in the mountains of Badakshan, unsavory animal products, and the ground bodies of South American insects to ones as common as sand, clay, and lime.<br><br>Compiled by a team of experts, each with an intimate knowledge of his or her subject, the entries are written in clear, accessible language and supplemented by numerous photographs and drawings. Each core material (glass, ceramics, textiles, paper, plastics, leather, metal, stone, wood, and paint) is covered from its raw state through any processing or preparation to various craft stages and finally, to any surface finishing. <br><br>Traditionally, the kind of information found in these pages has been passed on from craftsman to craftsman or confined to highly specialized books, and even common terms are often misunderstood. This dictionary makes the subject accessible to all&#x2014;from art and architectural historians, curators, collectors, restoration specialists, artists, and museum staff to decorators, aficionados, and those who enjoy watching <i>Antiques Roadshow.</i> In short, this book is for all those who are intrigued by the materials and techniques used to create the beautiful objects that surround us.</p><p><b>Lucy Trench</b> has been a conservator at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the editor of publications for the National Gallery, London, and materials and techniques editor for the Grove <i>Dictionary of Art.</i>In her introduction, editor Trench clearly states that "this dictionary focuses upon the materials and techniques used in the decorative arts." She admits that not everyone agrees as to what makes up the field of decorative arts, so the contributors adopted the criteria that the "objects or forms of decorations . . . have a practical purpose but are also prized for their beauty and craftsmanship." Photography has not been included because it does not always fit those criteria; graphic arts are included (although in limited detail) because of their importance in design and books illustration. Folk arts such as rosemaling are excluded. Seven major core materials (<i>Ceramics</i> , <i>Glass</i> , <i>Met</i> als, <i>Paper,</i> <i>Stone</i> , <i>Textiles</i> , and <i>Wood</i> ), as well as many minor ones (such as <i>Enamel, Ivory</i> , <i>Lacquer</i> , <i>Leather</i> , and <i>Shell),</i> are defined from their raw state through various stages and processes to their final products. Although the emphasis is upon Western media, attention is given to materials like jade and lacquer, which have been associated with the Orient but are prized in the West. Examples of other entries include <i>Intaglio, Ironstone china, Kiln, Marquetry, </i> and <i>Stonecarving tools.</i> The contributors are drawn from several disciplines and include scientists, conservators, and an art historian. The entries vary in length from a single sentence to several pages. Cross-references appear within entries in capital letters. There are also <i>see</i> references for some terms, directing the user to the preferred terminology. Measurements are given in metric rather than English units. Most of the many illustrations are black-and-white photographs of objects or craftspeople demonstrating a technique. Some of the illustrations have been taken from Diderot's eighteenth-century <i>Encyclopedie</i> because, as Trench explains in the introduction, "the clarity, elegance and precision of his plates are unsurpassed by any modern photograph or computer drawing." There are eight colored plates reproducing objects in different media or materials, from carved gems to block-print cottons.Although one of the photographs is of a detail of a leaded glass shade by Tiffany Studios, there are no entries for Louis Tiffany or his design firm. Some individuals do appear, such as Leo Baekeland (the inventor of Bakelite), but only in relation to the entry for a material or process. A bibliography follows the dictionary entries and includes general works as well as books arranged by materials, such as amber, ceramics, leather, metals, and paint.With its specialized subject coverage, this book will be valuable in academic and large public libraries. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington praised the black community in Durham, North Carolina, for its exceptional race progress. Migration, urbanization, and industrialization had turned black Durham from a post-Civil War liberation community into the "capital of the black middle class." African Americans owned and operated mills, factories, churches, schools, and an array of retail services, shops, community organizations, and race institutions. Using interviews, narratives, and family stories, Leslie Brown animates the history of this remarkable city from emancipation to the civil rights era, as freedpeople and their descendants struggled among themselves and with whites to give meaning to black freedom.<br><br>Brown paints Durham in the Jim Crow era as a place of dynamic change where despite common aspirations, gender and class conflicts emerged. Placing African American women at the center of the story, Brown describes how black Durham's multiple constituencies experienced a range of social conditions. Shifting the historical perspective away from seeing solidarity as essential to effective struggle or viewing dissent as a measure of weakness, Brown demonstrates that friction among African Americans generated rather than depleted energy, sparking many activist initiatives on behalf of the black community.<br><br></p><p>"In this meticulously researched and intelligently rendered history of black Durham, Leslie Brown masterfully documents the ways in which the 'capital of the black middle class' was forged through the cooperation of--and conflict between--African American women and men of the elite, aspiring, and working classes. This is a significant achievement and warrants a wide readership."--Martin Summers, University of Texas at Austin, author of <i>Manliness and Its Discontents: The Black Middle Class and the Transformation of Masculinity, 1900-1930</i> <br>Leslie Brown is assistant professor of history at Williams College.</p><h2>Portal Design in Radiation Therapy, 2nd ed</h2><p>Portal Design in Radiation Therapy, 2nd Edition contains over 120 explicit diagrams illustrating the anatomy and lymphatics included in typical treatment portals.

By the time he was thirty he was at the heart of British intellectual life. He has remained its commanding presence ever since, and few would dispute that he was one of Britain's greatest thinkers. His reputation extends worldwide--as a great conversationalist, intellectual historian, and man of letters. He has been called the century's most inspired reader.</p><br><p>Yet Berlin's contributions to thought--in particular to moral and political philosophy, and to liberal theory--are little understood, and surprisingly neglected by the academic world. In this book, they are shown to be animated by a single, powerful, subversive idea: <i>value-pluralism</i> which affirms the reality of a deep conflict between ultimate human values that reason cannot resolve. Though bracingly clear-headed, humane and realist, Berlin's value-pluralism runs against the dominant Western traditions, secular and religious, which avow an ultimate harmony of values. It supports a highly distinctive restatement of liberalism in Berlin's work--an agnostic liberalism, which is founded not on rational choice but on the radical choices we make when faced with intractable dilemmas. It is this new statement of liberalism, the central subject of John Gray's lively and lucid book, which gives the liberal intellectual tradition a new lease on life, a new source of life, and which comprises Berlin's central and enduring legacy.</p></p><p>For more than half a century, the renowned liberal thinker Sir Isaiah Berlin has occupied an important spot at the center of British intellectual and public life. Recipient of knighthood and the Order of Merit, he has been the head of an Oxford College and the director of the Royal Opera House. During World War II, he acted as Winston Churchill&#39;s eyes and ears in America. He is also a talented and prolific writer with five volumes of essays to his name. Surprisingly, John Gray&#39;s book is only the third full-length examination of one of this century&#39;s seminal thinkers.<b>John Gray</b> is a Fellow in Jesus College at the University of Oxford.

But only in Germany did racist stereotypes evolve into a popular ideology of such lethal force that it ended in the horror of the death camps. Despite a vast literature about anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, we do not yet understand why the destruction of the Jews was conceived and implemented by the Germans. Ideology of Death supplies this understanding in a stunning and disturbing narrative history. Exploring the unique nature of the German experience as well as the annals of anti-Semitism, Mr. Weiss rejects the notion that the Holocaust was a product of Nazi fanaticism. He shows instead how racist ideas ingrained in German culture led to the unthinkable. Tracing the culture of racism and anti-Semitism among powerful elites and ordinary Germans, Mr. Weiss shows how it grew rapidly during the Napoleonic era, became a forceful popular ideology in the 1870s, and in the 1890s gained the dedicated support of the generation that eventually brought Hitler to power. &#34;German Jews became the victims of a uniquely powerful culture of racism&#34;, he writes. &#34;Without this historical base, anti-Semitism would not have exploded with such fury after 1918, producing hundreds of thousands of followers whose ideas were no different from those of the Nazis&#34;. Drawing on the latest research, Mr. Weiss describes how the Nazis, building on traditional German anti-Semitism, adjusted their appeal to a wide variety of social groups that were crucial to their electoral success. The Nazis&#39; extraordinary popularity &#34;could not have occurred if Hitler&#39;s hatreds were unique&#34;, theauthor points out. Nor could the actions against the Jews, leading to their destruction. Most Germans saw nothing wrong with such actions. Mr. Weiss explains the specific complicities of various German groups and institutions in the Holocaust, and why they voluntarily cooperated with the Nazis.John Weiss's <i>Ideology of Death: Why the Holocaust Happened in Germany</i> was lauded for its balanced interpretation. Mr. Weiss is professor of history at Lehman College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and has also written <i>The Fascist Tradition and Conservatism in Europe</i>.</p><h2>One Day and One Amazing Morning on Orange Street</h2><p>When a mysterious man arrives one day on Orange Street, the children who live on the block try to find out who he is and why he&#x2019;s there.

She lives in Oakland, California.</p></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Gift</h2><p>Drawing on interviews with more than 20 surviving refugee scholars, the authors give a moving account of the scientific diaspora which resulted from Hitler&#39;s policy of dismissing Jewish scientists. The irony is that they went on to help win the war for the Allies. &#34;If the dismissal of Jewish scientists means the annihilation of contemporary German science, then we shall do without science for a few years!&#34; With these words Hitler closed the door on Germany&#39;s 50-year record of world supremacy in science. The subsequent exodus of German and Austrian scientists caused critical damage to Germany&#39;s scientific output and brought invaluable gains to the West. The Third Reich&#39;s losses included Einstein, and also Leo Szilard, who became the driving force behind the atomic bomb project. As one refugee remarked: &#34;Far from destroying the spirit of German scholarship, the Nazis had spread it all over the world. Only Germany was to be the loser.&#34; This book recounts how Britain played a significant role in rescuing the scientists and how, within weeks, leading British academics had set up an agency to support the exiles and help them to find jobs. Of the 1,500 refugees they rescued, 15 went on to win Nobel Prizes.</p><p></p><h2>Lenin for Beginners (Pantheon Documentary Comic Book)</h2><p>Paperbook. 1978, First Edition.

Tour.</p><p>Louise DeSalvo is the author of Conceived with Malice: Literature as Revenge, Breathless, and the internationally acclaimed study Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work, among other books. A professor of English at Hunter College in New York City, she lives in Teaneck, New Jersey.A biographer and literary critic's memoir of growing up in Hoboken, N.J., in a claustrophobic Italian-American family. DeSalvo (English/Hunter College; Conceived with Malice, 1994, etc.) was the first member of her working-class family to graduate from college. She escaped a stultifying home life--depressed and agoraphobic mother, belligerent and rigid father--through books, movies, study, and boys, boys, boys. She became a Virginia Woolf scholar, writing in her controversial 1989 study about the impact of childhood sexual abuse on Woolf's work. The effort to come to grips with the lingering mental strain caused by her mother's death, her sister's suicide, her memory of childhood traumas of her own--plus the intense, consuming life of an academic writer- -eventually compelled her to write about her own life in an effort to ``to give it some shape, some order.'' The result is an extremely readable book--if not necessarily a lovable one. DeSalvo's prose is plain; her tone often cool. We gain insight into her life and her mother's life--but not her dead sister's. New Jersey of the 1950s is vividly evoked, but DeSalvo's present situation as teacher, wife, and mother is less vivid. Among the book's best elements: a list of her mother's punitive and pathetic attempts at cooking--from liver, heart, and snails to head cheese, eels, and octupus. Vertigo's main failing is a lack of continuity; there is a grab-bag feeling to some of the reminiscences, and sometimes topics are misleadingly highlighted--a chapter called ``Anorexia,'' for example, is not about the anorexia of the author or anyone close to her, but rather about anorexia in general, and the effect is that of DeSalvo's trying to touch all possible feminist bases. Strangely cool, ultimately more successful as cultural history than psychological memoir, DeSalvo's book is nevertheless gripping in its parade of detail and profusion of stories about how ``a working-class Italian girl became a critic and writer.''

He was the father of modern polar exploration, the last act of territorial discovery before the leap into space began. Nansen was a prime illustration of Carlyle&#39;s dictum that &#34;the history of the world is but the biography of great men.&#34; He was not just a pioneer in the diverse fields of oceanography and skiing, but one of the founders of neurology. A restless, unquiet Faustian spirit, Nansen was a Renaissance Man born out of his time into the new Norway of Ibsen and Grieg. He was an artist and historian, a diplomat who had dealings with Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin, and played a part in the Versailles Peace Conference, where he helped the Americans in their efforts to contain the Bolsheviks. He also undertook famine relief in Russia. Finally, working for the League of Nations as both High Commissioner for Refugees and High Commissioner for the Repatriation of Prisoners of War, he became one of the first of the modern media-conscious international civil servants. This is a full-scale biography of Nansen, drawing on diaries and other documents.</p><p>The index for Roland Huntford's biography of polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen lists the following subcategories under Nansen's name: "academic career," "skiing pioneer," "explorer and innovator in polar equipment," "pioneering oceanographer," "Norwegian statesman," and "women: attractiveness to." Not a bad summary of Nansen's life, really. Fridtjof Nansen packed a lot of experiences into his 68-year lifetime, and Huntford explores them all in <i>Nansen: The Explorer as Hero</i>. It's not surprising, however, that the heart of this book is the <i>Fram</i> expedition, Nansen's three-year attempt to reach the North Pole. Though Nansen failed, turning back some 200 miles before reaching it, he did get 146 miles farther north than had ever been reached before and was celebrated as a hero upon his return to Norway. He turned this celebrity into political power, embarking on a diplomatic career and pressing for Norwegian independence. Along the way, Nansen engaged in a number of romantic intrigues (including an alleged affair with the wife of his polar rival, Robert Scott), helped popularize skiing, developed the neuron theory, and won a Nobel Peace Prize.<p> Nansen's life should make for excellent reading; <i>Nansen</i>, however, is less than engagingly written. Huntford's prose is frigid at times, but frequent quotations from Nansen's own letters, journals, and published works allow Nansen's voice--and his remarkable life--to shine through.</p>...a great virtue of Huntford's extraordinarily well-researched book is that it allows one to ponder the cost of the ideals Nansen so energetically lived up to. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Annette Kobak</i><br><br>...a splendid biography of a splendidly versatile man. -- <i><i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, Phoebe-Lou Adams</i></p><h2>Transformers: The Invisibility Factor (Find Your Fate Junior - Transformers)</h2><p>The reader&#39;s decisions will determine whether the Autobots or Decepticons gain control of an Earth scientist&#39;s invisibility device</p><p></p><h2>The Easter Egg Farm</h2><p>An amusing story about a hen that lays eggs with different patterns on them.</p><p>Mary Jane and Herm Auch have collaborated on more than ten picture books written by Mary Jane. Both artists used digital techniques to create the illustrations in this book. The Auchs live outside of Rochester, New York, and keep a small flock of chickens.Despite her yellow feathers, the personable Pauline is a hen of a different color--a sensitive fowl unable to "concentrate in all the confusion" of the henhouse. Her eggs, when they do appear, are of assorted vivid designs and colors, influenced by the objects she has just seen. Mrs. Pennywort, the farm's owner, senses an Eastertime gold mine and begins "taking Pauline on field trips for inspiration." (At the museum, Pauline's Mona Lisa egg is a rare treasure.) Nature takes its course, however, and soon kaleidoscopic chicks emerge from the shells. In time Pauline's progeny produce their own coveted eggs, and mother enjoys a well-earned, colorful retirement. Judging from her energetic, tongue-in-cheek text, Auch has adroitly mastered the leap from middle-grade novels to picture books. Her rib-tickling illustrations feature a gangly, Modigliani-necked Mrs. Pennywort, (over)dressed to the teeth; an eminently expressive Pauline; and of course, those spectacular ovoids. One witty scene follows another--Pauline on point watching the ballet (more inspiration), beside a rhinestone-dripping Mrs. P.; the hapless lady desperately trying to glue cracked eggs back together.

Tall ships navigate familiar and foreign waters, and ambitious young men without rank or status seek their futures in Naval commands. First Lieutenant Alexander Clay of the&nbsp;<i>Agrius</i> is self-made, clever, and ready for the new age. But the old world, dominated by patronage, retains a tight hold on advancement. Though Clay has proven himself many times over, Captain Percy Follett is determined to promote his own nephew.<br> Before Clay finds a way to receive due credit for his exploits, he'll first need to survive them. Ill-conceived expeditions ashore, hunts for privateers in treacherous fog, and a desperate chase across the Atlantic are only some of the challenges he faces. He must endeavor to bring his ship and crew through a series of adventures stretching from the bleak coast of Flanders to the warm waters of the Caribbean. Only then might high society recognize his achievements--and allow him to ask for the hand of Lydia Browning, the woman who loves him regardless of his station.</p><p>Philip K. Allan comes from Watford in the United Kingdom. He still lives in Hertfordshire with his wife and his two teenage daughters. He has spent most of his working life to date as a senior manager in the motor industry. It was only in the last few years that he has given that up to concentrate on his novels full time. He has an excellent knowledge of the 18th century navy, having studied it as part of his history degree at London University, which awoke a lifelong passion for the period. He is a member of the Society for Nautical Research and a keen sailor. He believes the period has unrivalled potential for a writer, stretching from the age of piracy via the voyages of Cook to the battles and campaigns of Nelson. From a creative point of view he finds it offers him a wonderful platform for his work. On the one hand there is the strange, claustrophobic wooden world of the period&#39;s ships; and on the other hand there is the boundless freedom to move those ships around the globe wherever the narrative takes them. All these possibilities are fully exploited in the Alexander Clay series of novels. His inspiration for the series was to build on the works of novelists like C.S. Forester and in particular Patrick O&#39;Brian. His prose is heavily influenced by O&#39;Brian&#39;s immersive style. He too uses meticulously researched period language and authentic nautical detail to draw the reader into a different world. But the Alexander Clay books also bring something fresh to the genre, with a cast of fully formed lower deck characters with their own back histories and plot lines in addition to the officers. Think Downton Abbey on a ship, with the lower deck as the below stairs servants."Philip K. Allan brings a fresh new voice to naval fiction under sail with his debut novel, <i>The Captain's Nephew</i>...a captivating entry in naval fiction, replete with true to life characters, well-drawn officers and striking Jack Tars. A sea breeze drifts off the pages, along with the reek ofpowder smoke." -- <b>Quarterdeck Magazine</b> <br> <br>"Allan wastes no time from the first page in getting me hooked...His verbiage from the start maximizes utility while still presenting as fluid and gorgeous, with such realism that we can virtually see the scene as it occurs. <i>The Captain's Nephew</i>--a seafaring adventure...told by a storyteller well-versed in his craft, it is a tale to re-visit time and again as we eagerly await the next." -- <b>Before the Second Sleep</b><br><br><i>The Captain's Nephew</i>&nbsp;opens with a mesmerizing and vivid portrayal of a man drowning and then regresses six months to show the events that culminate in this tragic incident. From first page to last, Allan bewitches and transports readers back to 1796 to walk the decks of a wooden ship and engage the enemy all the while experiencing what the characters endure. Equally compelling is that this is not just a tale of the officers of the Royal Navy. Interludes are woven into the story to personalize and recreate life on the lower decks, as well as to provide glimpses of what it was like for loved ones left behind. This first book in the Alexander Clay series offers a satisfying resolution of who dies, while only hinting at how it happens - an intriguing and perfect enticement for readers who will eagerly await the next chapter in Clay's pursuit of his naval career and the woman he loves.<b>Cindy Vallar, Editor &amp; Reviewer&nbsp;</b><br><br><i>The Captain's Nephew</i>&nbsp;is one whirlwind of a ride, excellently detailed, andhad me clinging to every page.

You and I have been friends for a long time and I always knew you were born to write romantic suspense. When and how did you figure it out?</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Lowell:</strong> Like you, I wanted to write romantic suspense for years, but no one wanted to buy it. Then a publisher bought <i>Tell Me No Lies</i>. I was thrilled. The book did well, but the publisher didn&#x2019;t. Eventually I had another opportunity to write romantic suspense. <i>Amber Beach</i> was a New York Times bestseller. After that, it was much easier to sell romantic suspense!</p> <p><strong>JAK: </strong>Your female characters have a real edge. They are strong, competent, sexy, and smart, yet always feminine. Shaye, the lead character in <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>, is a perfect example. As a writer, how do you define feminine and masculine strength? </p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> I believe that male and female are complementary. A strong man can protect a woman. A strong woman allows a man to be gentle. Each brings possibilities to the other; each fulfills needs in the other. Each could live independently but chooses to share life with another. Love is itself an expression of strength.</p> <p><strong>JAK: </strong>You have a rare gift for creating powerful settings. The landscape is always a character in your books. You recently moved to a cattle ranching valley in Nevada and used it as a backdrop for <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>. Why did this location call to you so profoundly, in life and in your writing?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> The mountains are tall, the land beyond the fences is wild, and I have always felt at home. I enjoy visiting cities, but I can&#x2019;t live well in them. Something in me needs long views and mountain winds.</p> <p><strong>JAK: </strong>The intrigue in your novels always has an authentic &#x201c;ripped from the headlines&#x201d; feel. I know you do a great deal of research before you sit down to write. What is the &#x201c;real story&#x201d; behind <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> <i>Dangerous Refuge</i> isn&#x2019;t based on any &#x201c;real&#x201d; event. The story came from an understanding of how the Intermountain West is caught between the past, when there were few people in a huge land, and the present, when too many people depend on too few resources. Simply put, much of the West lacks water. From that truth comes much friction, intrigue, competition, wealth . . . and death. While the backdrop is very real, the story is pure fiction.</p> <p><strong>JAK:</strong> You used MMA (mixed martial arts) in the plot of <i>Dangerous Refuge</i>. How did you decide that it fit into the premise of this book?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> There is a unique grittiness to the sport. Gambling as a plot device is commonplace in Nevada settings. I wanted something different.</p> <p><strong>JAK:</strong> You and I tend to enjoy the same books so I&#x2019;m curious: what are you reading now?</p> <p><strong>EL:</strong> J. D. Robb&#x2019;s latest, <i>Calculated in Death</i>. When I&#x2019;m done, I&#x2019;ll begin nagging you for a preview of your next book.</p> <p><strong>JAK:</strong> I&#x2019;ve said it before and I&#x2019;ll say it again: When it comes to romantic suspense, no one does it better than Elizabeth Lowell.

But there's at least one good thing you can say about this otherwise awful flick: it's prevented the movie's far superior source material from being forgotten. Roger Zelazny's post-apocalypse novel predates the George Peppard-Jan-Michael Vincent vehicle by about a decade and represents the fine storytelling talents of one of science fiction and fantasy's most daring writers (likely best remembered for his imaginative Amber series).<p> Speaking of vehicles: the coolest part of the movie--and likely, thankfully, the only part most people remember--turns out to be even cooler in the book: the flame-spewing, .50-caliber-bullet-belching, grenade-throwing, gigantic all-terrain vehicle that's responsible for getting a crucial antiserum shipment from Los Angeles to Boston to stop a deadly plague. The driver, a despicable lowlife named Hell Tanner, has been given a not-so-difficult choice. He can either get the drugs to the East Coast intact, save humanity, and receive a full pardon for his crimes, or he can refuse and spend the rest of his life in a "zebra suit." So what's the catch? Thanks to World War III, Middle America is now an electrical-storm-torn, heavily irradiated playground for dino-sized Gila monsters, "freak spiders," humongous bats "that eat off the mutie fruit trees down Mexico way," and 120-foot-long snakes as big around as garbage cans. And the native humans still scrambling around the wasteland aren't much less dangerous.</p><p> <i>Damnation Alley</i> might not be Zelazny's best, but for reading on, say, a road trip, you can't do much better. Throw in some '60s-style, freak-out closing riffs, and a trip down the <i>Alley</i> becomes pretty hard to pass up. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Zelazny wrote many novels, short stories, and novellas, including Nebula and Hugo Award winners &#34;24 VIEWS OF MOUNT FUJI, BY HOKUSAT&#34;, &#34;PERMAFROST&#34; and &#34;HOME IS THE HANGMAN&#34;.</p><h2>Rhythms of Vision: The Changing Patterns of Belief</h2><p>Draws on various branches of knowledge to indicate the imminence of a new era characterized by our recognition of the correspondences among the universe, the natural world, and man</p><p></p><h2>With Signs Following</h2><p>With Signs Following</p><p></p><h2>The Cover-Up at Omaha Beach: D-Day, the US Rangers, and the Untold Story of Maisy Battery</h2><p>The Rangers&#x2019; mission was clear.

Simultaneously, other Ranger units would scale the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc to destroy the ostensibly huge gun battery there and thus protect the invasion fleet from being targeted. But was the Pointe du Hoc mission actually necessary? Why did the Allies plan and execute an attack on a gun battery that they knew in advance contained no field guns?

Testing themselves against treacherous currents, braving depths that induced hallucinatory effects, navigating through wreckage as perilous as a minefield, they pushed themselves to their limits and beyond, brushing against death more than once in the rusting hulks of sunken ships.<br>But in the fall of 1991, not even these courageous divers were prepared for what they found 230 feet below the surface, in the frigid Atlantic waters sixty miles off the coast of New Jersey: a World War II German U-boat, its ruined interior a macabre wasteland of twisted metal, tangled wires, and human bones&#x2013;all buried under decades of accumulated sediment.<br>No identifying marks were visible on the submarine or the few artifacts brought to the surface. No historian, expert, or government had a clue as to which U-boat the men had found.

Against his better judgment, that fisherman promised to tell Nagle how to find it. The men agreed to meet the next day on the rickety wooden pier that led to Nagle's boat, the Seeker, a vessel Nagle had built to chase possibility. But when the appointed time came, the fisherman was not there. Nagle paced back and forth, careful not to plunge through the pier where its wooden planks had rotted away. He had lived much of his life on the Atlantic, and he knew when worlds were about to shift. Usually, that happened before a storm or when a man's boat broke. Today, however, he knew it was going to happen when the fisherman handed him a scrap of paper, a hand-scrawled set of numbers that would lead to the sunken mystery. Nagle looked into the distance for the fisherman. He saw no one. The salt air blew against the small seashore town of Brielle, tilting the dockside boats and spraying the Atlantic into Nagle's eyes. When the mist died down he looked again. This time, he saw the fisherman approaching, a small square of paper crumpled in his hands. The fisherman looked worried. Like Nagle, he had lived on the ocean, and he also knew when a man's life was about to change.<br><br>In the whispers of approaching autumn, Brielle's rouge is blown away and what remains is the real Brielle, the locals' Brielle. This small seashore town on the central New Jersey coast is the place where the boat captains and fishermen live, where convenience store owners stay open to serve neighbors, where fifth graders can repair scallop dredges. This is where the hangers-on and wannabes and also-rans and once-greats keep believing in the sea. In Brielle, when the customers leave, the town's lines show, and they are the kind grooved by the thin difference between making a living on the water and washing out.<br><br>The Seeker towers above the other boats tied to this Brielle dock, and it's not just the vessel's sixty-five-foot length that grabs one's attention, it's the feeling-from her battered wooden hull and nicked propellers-that she's been places. Conceived in Nagle's imagination, the Seeker was built for a single purpose: to take scuba divers to the most dangerous shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean.<br><br>Nagle was forty years old then, a thin, deeply tanned former Snap-On Tools Salesman of the Year. To see him here, waiting for this fisherman in his tattered T-shirt and thrift-shop sandals, the Jim Beam he kept as best friend slurring his motions, no one would guess that he had been an artist, that in his day Nagle had been great.<br><br>In his twenties, Nagle was already legend in shipwreck diving, a boy wonder in a sport that regularly kills its young. In those days, deep-wreck diving was still the province of the adventurer. Countless shipwrecks, even famous ones, lay undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic, and the hunt for those wrecks-with their bent metal and arrested history-was the motion that primed Nagle's imagination.<br><br>Treasure never figured into the equation for Atlantic shipwreck divers in the Northeast. Spanish galleons overflowing with gold doubloons and silver pieces of eight did not sink in this part of the ocean, and even if they had, Nagle wouldn't have been interested. His neighborhood was the New York and New Jersey shipping lanes, waters that conducted freighters, ocean liners, passenger vessels, and warships about the business and survival of America. These wrecks occasionally surrendered a rare piece of china or jewelry, but Nagle and his kind were looking for something different. They saw stories in the Modiglianied faces of broken ships, frozen moments in a nation's hopes or a captain's dying instinct or a child's potential, and they experienced these scenes unbuffered by curators or commentators or historians, shoulder to shoulder with life as it existed at the moment it had most mattered.<br><br>And they did it to explore. Many of the deep wrecks hadn't been seen since their victims last looked at them, and would remain lost while nature pawed at them until they simply didn't exist anymore. In a world where even the moon had been traveled, the floor of the Atlantic remained uncharted wilderness, its shipwrecks beacons for men compelled to look.<br><br>You had to have steel balls to do what Nagle did in his heyday. In the 1970s and 1980s, scuba equipment was still rudimentary, not much advanced past 1943, when Jacques Cousteau helped invent the system of tanks and regulators that allowed men to breathe underwater. Even at 130 feet, the recreational limit suggested by most scuba training organizations, a minor equipment failure could kill the most skilled practitioner. In searching for the most interesting wrecks, Nagle and the sport's other kings might descend to 200 feet or deeper, virtually begging the forces of nature to flick them into the afterlife, practically demanding their biology to abandon them. Men died-often-diving the shipwrecks that called to Nagle.<br><br>Even if Nagle's equipment and body could survive the deep Atlantic, he faced a smorgasbord of other perils, each capable of killing him � la carte. For starters, the sport was still new; there was no ancient wisdom to be passed from father to son, the kind of collective experience that routinely keeps today's divers alive. The sport's cautionary tales, those lifelines learned over beers with buddies and by reading magazines and attending classes, were beaten into Nagle underwater at antihuman depths. If Nagle found himself in some crazy, terrible circumstance-and there were countless of them on these deep wrecks-odds were that he would be the one who would tell the first tale. When he and his ilk survived, the magazines wrote articles about them.<br><br>Nagle pushed deeper. Diving below 200 feet, he began doing things scientists didn't fully understand, going places recreational divers had never been. When he penetrated a shipwreck at these depths, he was often among the first to see the vessel since it had gone down, the first to open the purser's safe since it had been closed, the first to look at these men since they had been lost at sea. But this also meant that Nagle was on his own. He had no maps drawn by earlier divers. Had someone visited these wrecks before, he might have told Nagle, "Don't brush against that outboard beam in the galley-the thing moved when I swam by, and the whole room might cave in and bury you if you do." Nagle had to discover all this by himself. It is one thing, wreck divers will tell you, to slither in near-total darkness through a shipwreck's twisted, broken mazes, each room a potential trap of swirling silt and collapsing structure. It is another to do so without knowing that someone did it before you and lived.<br><br>The Atlantic floor was still a wilderness in Nagle's prime, and it demanded of its explorers the same grit that the American West did of its pioneers. A single bad experience on a shipwreck could reroute all but the hardiest souls to more sensible pursuits. Early divers like Nagle had bad experiences every day. The sport eagerly shook out its dabblers and sightseers; those who remained seemed of a different species. They were physical in their world orientation and sudden in their appetites. They thought nothing of whipping out a sledgehammer and beating a porthole from the side of a ship, even as their heavy breath hastened nitrogen narcosis, the potentially deadly buildup of that otherwise benign gas in their brains. Underwater, rules of possession bent with the light; some divers cut prizes from the mesh goody bags of other divers, following the motto "He who floats it owns it." Fistfights-aboard boats and even underwater-often settled disputes. Artifacts recovered from wrecks were guarded like firstborn children, occasionally at knifepoint. In this way, early deep-wreck divers had a measure of pirate in their blood.<br><br>But not Nagle. In the sport's brawniest era, he was a man of the mind. He devoured academic texts, reference works, novels, blueprints, any material he could uncover on historical ships, until he could have stood in the dockyards of a dozen eras and built the boats alongside the workers. He was a connoisseur of the parts, and he reveled in the life force a boat took on from the interlocking of its pieces. This insight gave Nagle two-way vision; as much as he understood the birth of a ship, he also understood its death. Ordinary divers would come upon a shipwreck and see the m�lange of bent steel and broken wood, the shock of pipe and wire as a cacophony of crap, an impediment that might be hiding a compass or some other prize. They would plant their noses in a random spot and dig like puppies, hoping to find a morsel. Viewing the same scene, Nagle repaired the broken parts in his mind and saw the ship in its glory. One of his greatest finds was a four-foot-tall brass whistle from the paddle wheeler Champion, a proud voice that had been mounted on the ship's mast and powered by a steam line. The whistle was majestic, but the most beautiful part of the discovery was that underwater it looked like a worthless pipe. Floating amid the wreckage, Nagle used his mind's eye to watch the ship break and sink. He knew the ship's anatomy, and as he imagined it coming apart he could see the whistle settle, right where that seemingly worthless piece of pipe lay. After Nagle recovered two helms from the British tanker Coimbra in a single day (finding one helm once in a career was rare enough), his photograph was hung-alongside that of Lloyd Bridges-in the wheelhouse of the Sea Hunter, a leading dive charter boat of the time. He was twenty-five.<br><br>To Nagle, the value in artifacts like the brass steam whistle lay not in their aesthetics or their monetary worth but in their symbolism. It is an odd sight to see grown men covet teacups and saucers, and build noble display cases to these dainty relics. But to divers like Nagle these trinkets represented exploration, going off the charts. A telegraph on display in a diver's living room, therefore, is much more than a shiny object; it is an announcement. It says, If someone had been to this ship's wheelhouse before me, he would not have left this telegraph behind.<br><br>It was only time before Nagle's instinct delivered him to the Andrea Doria, the Mount Everest of shipwrecks. The grand Italian passenger liner had collided with the Stockholm, a Swedish liner, in dense fog off Nantucket Island in 1956. Fifty-one people died; 1,659 were rescued before the liner sank and settled on her side at a depth of 250 feet. The Doria was not a typical target for Nagle. Her location was widely known, and she had been explored by divers since the day after her sinking. But the Doria made siren calls to great wreck divers. She was brimming with artifacts even after all these years: serving sets made of fine Italian china and painted with the ship's legendary Italia logo, silver utensils, luggage, ceramic tiles by famed artists, pewter sherbet dishes, jewelry, signs. In Nagle's day, and even today, a diver could explore the Doria and worry only about having enough stamina to lug home the prizes he recovered.<br><br>Had the Doria only her riches to offer, she could not have romanced Nagle so hopelessly. The ship's real challenge lay in exploration. The wreck rested on its side, making navigation dangerous and deceptive. A diver had to conceive the world sideways to make sense of doors on the floor and ceilings to the right. And she was deep-180 feet at her shallowest and 250 feet where she crushed the ocean floor. Men sometimes got disoriented or ran out of air or lost their minds from narcosis and died on the Doria. The wreck was so deep, dark, and dangerous that decades after her sinking, entire decks remained unexplored. Those decks were Nagle's destinations.<br><br>Over time, Nagle penetrated the wreck in places long relegated to the impossible. His mantel at home became a miniature Doria museum. Soon, he set his sights on the bell. A ship's bell is her crown, her voice. For a diver, there is no greater prize, and many of the greats go a career without coming close to recovering one. Nagle decided to own the Doria's bell. People thought he was nuts-scores of divers had searched for thirty years for the Doria's bell. No one believed it was there.<br><br>Nagle went to work. He studied deck plans, books of photographs, crew diaries. Then he did what few other divers did: he formulated a plan. He would need days, maybe even a week to pull it off. No charter boat, however, was going to take a diver to the Doria for a week. So Nagle, who had saved a good bit of money from his Snap-on Tools days, decided to buy a dive boat himself, a vessel constructed from his imagination for a single purpose: to salvage the Doria's bell.<br><br>That boat was the original Seeker, a thirty-five-foot Maine Coaster built in New Jersey by Henrique. In 1985, Nagle recruited five top divers, men who shared his passion for exploration, and he made this arrangement: He would take the group to the Doria at his expense. The trip would be a dedicated one, meaning the divers went with just one objective-to recover the bell.<br><br>For the first few days on the wreck, the divers stuck to Nagle's plan. They found nothing. The bell just wasn't there. At that point, even the hardiest divers would have turned back. A single day on the open Atlantic in a sixty-five-foot boat will turn intestines inside out; Nagle and his cohorts had been out for four days in a thirty-five-foot glorified bathtub. But a man is not so inclined to give up when he sees in panoramas. Nagle abandoned the bow of the Doria, where he and his team had been searching, and rerouted to the stern. They would now be flying by the seat of their pants, an improvisation on the deadliest wreck in the Atlantic. No one had ever been to the stern. Yet by conceiving the Doria as a single, breathing organism rather than as detached, twenty-foot chunks of wood and steel, Nagle and the others allowed themselves to look in unlikely places.<br><br>On the fifth day they hit pay dirt-there was the Andrea Doria's bell. The men rigged it, beat out the bell's pin with a sledgehammer, and sent up the prize on a heavy-duty lift bag. Shock waves rippled through the diving community. According to their agreement, Nagle owned half the bell, and the other five men owned half; the last man living among them would own it outright. Nagle placed the 150-pound bell into the back of his wife's station wagon and asked her to drive it home.</p><h2>The Pharmacy Technician: Foundations &amp; Practices (Custom Edition for Condensed Curriculum International)</h2><p>Set of four books includes text book The Pharmacy Technician Foundations &amp; Practices Custom Ed for Condensed curriculum Intl; 567 pgs with CD Rom, Lab Manual &amp; Workbook 2nd Ed, Text and Workbook Answer Key, and Student Workbook</p><p></p><h2>The Temple of Truth (Dumarest of Terra)</h2><p>Earl Dumarest travels to the world of the Guardians in hopes of finding information about the legendary planet, Earth, but is pursued by the Cyclan, who hope to steal his body-switching formula</p><p></p><h2>Mrs. Malory and the Lilies That Fester: A Sheila Malory Mystery</h2><p>Sheila Malory turns sleuth once again when the unsavory Gordon Masefield turns up dead and her future daughter-in-law becomes a prime suspect in the crime.

Courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Courage that defined the generation of men who fought in Vietnam.</p><p>Doyle Glass is an historian and sculptor who spent four years researching and writing this book. He conducted approximately 75 interviews of veterans, friends and family members of veterans. As a sculptor, Glass specializes in military monuments. He sculpted the Kentucky Medal of Honor Memorial in Louisville and the Texas Medal of Honor Memorial for Midland. He lives in Louisville, Kentucky.The author of this gripping account of Vietnam infantry combat set out to redeem the reputation of the American fighting man in a very controversial conflict. He has thoroughly researched and extensively interviewed to produce this, the story of Operation Medina, fought in the Da Nang region in summer 1967, largely by the First Battalion of the First Marine Regiment. The average marine enlistee involved was 19; the average officer, 24. Although they began with much to learn, they did learn it and eventually prevailed in bitter (and vividly described) close infantry combat of the ugliest sort. Despite his patriotic agenda, Glass finally gives credit where it is most due, to the grunts who, like their fellows in other wars, bore the lion's share of the burden in Vietnam. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The book's elegantly spare design fits its Zen-influenced theme: a watercolor on the left, framed in a white border, faces a haiku on the right. The girl reaches for a drifting maple leaf in the first spread ("One leaf rides the wind./ Quick as I am, it's quicker!/ Just beyond my grasp") and Hartung (Dear Juno) places her squarely at the garden's entrance. As she admires bonsai ("a miniature forest"), views a pagoda (with its "five roofs [that] stretch to heaven") and drinks tea in a teahouse, the artist fills in details that trace her pathway before the girl lies down beside a lotus-covered pond: "What do flowers dream?/ Adrift on eight pond pillows,/ pink-cheeked blossoms rest." Notes in smaller type below offer more information (lotus blossoms "represent purity and mirror the soul's ability to reach beyond muddy waters to the sunlight of a better existence"). Little birds and a saucy cat accompany the girl through gently tinted, sweetly stylized paintings. The last spread shows the entire garden, revealing the girl's progression through it. Mannis's haiku act as both a guide to some of the elements of traditional Japanese culture and a useful introduction to the haiku form. Hartung's watercolors combine areas of finer draftsmanship with simple washes; in the artist's hands, the landscape becomes a series of meditative images.

Find out why Odd Thomas is the master storyteller&#39;s most talked about creation. Strange times need strange heroes. Odd Thomas lives always between two worlds. He can see the lingering dead and knows that even in chaos, there is order, purpose, and strange meaning that invites our understanding but often thwarts it. Intuition has brought Odd Thomas to the quaint town of Magic Beach on the California coast. As he waits to learn why he has been drawn there, he finds work as a cook and assistant to a once-famous film actor who, at eighty has become an eccentric with as long a list of fears as he has stories about Hollywood&#39;s golden days. Odd is having dreams of a red tide, vague but worrisome. By day he senses a free-floating fear in the air of the town, as if unleashed by the crashing waves. But nothing prepares him for the hard truth of what he will discover as he comes face to face with a form of evil that will test him as never before...</p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive Essay: Destiny and <i>Odd Hours</i></b> <p></p> Odd Thomas came to me as a gift, the entire first chapter of his first book having poured out of me as I was in the middle of writing <i>The Face</i>. I wrote it by hand, though I never work that way, and I never hesitated to think what should come next. He was fully-realized in my mind from the moment I began to write in that lined legal tablet. With other stories and characters, I can identify the source of the inspiration, but not with Oddie and his books. He just suddenly was. When I write about him, his narrative voice is so clear to me that I almost hear him in my head. <p></p> For those among you who long have thought that I should be institutionalized, just relax: I said I almost hear him. <p></p> Many times over the years, I said I would never write an open-ended series. Then along came Oddie, and he proved me wrong. Or so I thought. As I wrote the first chapter of <i>Odd Hours</i>, the fourth featuring my fry-cook hero, I realized that this was not an open-ended series, after all, but that it would conclude with six or seven novels. I now think seven. <p></p> I suddenly saw the end point of his journey, the arc of it to the final book, and I was stunned. Beginning with this fourth story, the stakes were being raised dramatically; Oddie was going to face far more physical and moral danger than previously; and he was going to mature toward the fulfillment of a destiny that I had not seen coming until that moment. <p></p> Initially, I tried to argue myself out of the direction that <i>Odd Hours</i> was taking. I didn't believe that the first three books had put down a sufficient foundation to support the formidable architecture that I saw rising from it in the next three or four novels. <p></p> When I began to reread the first three books, however, I quickly discovered that I had unconsciously paved the road that the series was now taking. I had thought I was writing a series with an overall theme about the power and beauty of humility. Indeed I was, but it was also something more than that; and Oddie's ultimate destiny will not be merely purification to a state of absolute humility, but will be that and something else I find quite wonderful. <p></p> What lies ahead will be a challenge to write--or perhaps not. The character of Odd Thomas was a gift to me, and now I see that the entire architecture of a seven-book series was another gift that came to me complete on the same day Oddie arrived, although I needed time to recognize it. <p></p> This world is a place of wonder, and life is a mysterious enterprise; but nothing in all my years has been more mysterious than Odd Thomas's origins and my compulsion to write about him. <p></p> <i>-- Dean Koontz</i> <br><br>Dean Koontz is the author of more than a dozen New York Times No.1 bestsellers.

The role of intellectuals in racial strife is explored in an international context that puts the American experience in a wholly new light.<br><br> Intellectuals have played a major role in racial issues throughout the centuries. Though their individual views may differ, as a whole their views tend to group, and just over the course of the twentieth century, they have shifted from one end of the spectrum to the other. Surprisingly, these radically different views of race were held by intellectuals whose views on other issues were often very similar.<br><br> <i>Intellectuals and Race</i> is not, however, a book about history, even though it has much historical evidence, as well as demographic, geographic, and economic evidence - all of it directed toward testing the underlying assumptions about race that have prevailed at times among intellectuals in general, and especially at their highest levels. Nor is this simply a theoretical exercise. Sowell's ultimate concern is the impact of intellectual movements on the larger society, both past and present. These ideas and crusades have ranged widely from racial theories of intelligence to eugenics to ''social justice'' and multiculturalism.<br><br> In addition to in-depth examinations of these and other issues, <i>Intellectuals and Race</i> explores the incentives, the visions, and the rationales that drive intellectuals at the highest levels to conclusions that have often turned out to be counterproductive and even disastrous, not only for particular racial or ethnic groups but for societies as a whole.</p><p>THOMAS SOWELL has taught economics at Cornell, UCLA, Amherst, and other academic institutions, and his <i>Basic Economics</i> has been translated into six languages. He is currently a scholar in residence at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. He has been published in both academic journals and such popular media as the <i>Wall Street Journal, Forbes</i>, and <i>Fortune</i> and writes a syndicated column that appears in newspapers across the country.Lamenting the tendency toward one-dimensional analysis of race status in the U.S., Sowell explores the various perspectives that intellectuals have brought to race on how racial groups have affected and been effected by the sociopolitics of their era. He analyzes the early twentieth-century notions of genetic determination, or biology as destiny, which evolved into the eugenics movement and the foundation of Nazism, and he juxtaposes this with the late twentieth-century intellectual assessment of discrimination as the dominant cause of race status. Sowell digs beneath the intellectual arguments to offer more nuanced and complex consideration of attitudes on race and racism. For example, he notes that white project dwellers in Britain &#x201c;act out&#x201d; in ways similar to those of black American ghetto dwellers and that, at the turn of the twentieth century, black northerners were not segregated until the arrival of southern black migrants, whom they criticized nearly as much as whites did. Through myriad other observations, Sowell analyzes the significance of class in perspectives on race and considers how intellectuals themselves are driven to their positions. --Vernon Ford</p><h2>Invisibles, The: Bloody Hell in America VOL 04</h2><p>In a world where paranoia is a survival skill, the only hope for humankind is a group of unconventional occultist freedom fighters called the Invisibles.

He now lives in Suffolk with his wife Annette and they have two grown-up children, Ben and Amanda. The inspiration for the Percy the Park Keeper books came from Nick&#39;s many walks through the local park with the family dog Jake.Kindergarten-Grade 2-- One cold, snowy night, a kindhearted park attendant finds his hospitality stretched to the limit as one pathetic, shivering forest animal after another asks to share his bed. The result--too many animals, not enough room. Just as Percy tries to sort out the tangled bedclothes, the animals panic upon hearing unearthly scratching from below the floor. Not to worry--it's only a mole, also seeking warmth, but during that intervening time each animal has discovered a cozy niche in Percy's messy quarters ideally suited to its needs. The illustrations are lighthearted and the penultimate scene of the cluttered room is a wealth of eye-catching details. Percy's bulletin board, with notes from Santa and an invitation from H. R. H. reveal Butterworth's whimsical sense of humor. While not breaking any new ground, this is an ingratiating if not exceptional wintertime selection. --Phyllis G.

Spanning the century from 1820 to 1920, it tells the story of Michael Morris Healy, a white Irish immigrant planter in Georgia; his African American slave Eliza Clark Healy, who was also his wife; and their nine children. Legally slaves, these brothers and sisters were smuggled north before the Civil War to be educated. In spite of the hardships imposed by American society on persons of mixed racial heritage, the Healy children achieved considerable success. Rejecting the convention that defined as black anyone with &#34;one drop of Negro blood,&#34; they were able to transform themselves into white Americans. Their unlikely ally in this transition was the Catholic church, as several of them became priests or nuns. One brother served as a bishop in Maine, another as rector of the Cathedral in Boston, and a third as president of Georgetown University. Of the two sisters who became nuns, one was appointed the superior of convents in the United States and Canada. Another brother served for twenty years as a captain in the U.S. Coast Guard, enforcing law and order in the waters off Alaska. The Healy children&#39;s transition from black to white should not have been possible according to the prevailing understandings of race, but they accomplished it with apparent ease. Relying on their abilities, and in most cases choosing celibacy, which precluded mixed-race offspring, they forged a place for themselves. They also benefited from the support of people in the church and elsewhere. Even those white Americans who knew the family&#39;s background chose to overlook their African ancestry and thereby help them to &#34;get away&#34; with passing. By exploring the lifelong struggles of the members of the Healy family to redefine themselves in a racially polarized society, this book makes a distinctive contribution to our understanding of the enduring dilemma of race in America.</p><p>The extraordinary saga of a mixed-race family in nineteenth-century America. <p>An Alternate Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. </p><p>Winner of the New England Historical Association Book Award.</p>James M.

He entered Boston Grammar School when he was eight and later attended George Brown Ell&#x2019;s school. When he was twelve his father apprenticed him to his half-brother James as a printer. James was later the publisher of the <b>New England Courant</b>, where Franklin&#x2019;s first articles, <b>The Dogood Papers</b>, were published before he was seventeen. He went to Philadelphia in 1723 and pursued his trade of printer. He was befriended by William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania, who offered to help the young man get started in business. Franklin left for England, where he hoped to arrange for the purchase of printing equipment. Arriving in London in 1724, he was soon deserted by Keith, and again turned to printing for a livelihood. His privately printed <b>Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain</b> (1725) introduced him to leading Deists and other intellectuals in London. A year later, he returned to Philadelphia, and by 1730 he had been appointed public printer for Pennsylvania. In 1731 he established the first circulation library in the United States; in 1743-44, The American Philosophical Society. In 1748 he retired from the trade of printer but continued to advise and back his partner and to draw profit from the business. <b>Poor Richard&#x2019;s Almanack</b> was his most spectacular success as a publisher, having gone through numerous editions and been translated in many languages. During the next thirty-five years he devoted himself largely to politics and diplomacy, but still wrote and engaged in scientific ventures. He resigned as Minister to France in 1785, returned to America, and was elected President of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Still concerned with the rights of the individual, he published papers encouraging the abolition of slavery. He died in Philadelphia in 1790.<i>Part One<br>Twyford, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's, 1771.</i><br><br>Dear son:<br>I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the journey I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements. Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.<br><br>That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some sinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable. But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.<br><br>Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this may be read or not as any one pleases. And, lastly (I may as well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity. Indeed, I scarce ever heard or saw the introductory words, Without vanity I may say, etc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the other comforts of life.<br><br>And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His kind providence, which led me to the means I used and gave them success. My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as others have done; the complexion of my future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.<br><br>The notes of one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was the name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom),* on a freehold of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business, a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of their births, marriages, and burials, from the year 1555 only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding. By that register, I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship. There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in 1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Richard Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin, and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will among them find many more particulars.<br><br>Thomas was bred a smith under his father, but being ingenious, and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for the business of scrivener,* became a considerable man in the county, was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were related of him, and much taken notice of and patronized by the then Lord Halifax. He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born. The account we received of his life and character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine. "Had he died on the same day," you said, "one might have supposed a transmigration."<br><br>John was bred a dyer, I believe, of woolens. Benjamin was bred a silk dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. I remember him well, for, when I was a boy, he came over to my father in Boston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a great age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left behind him two quarto volumes. MS., of his own poetry, consisting of little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.* He had formed a shorthand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practicing it, I have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in his shorthand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell lately into my hands in London a collection he had made of all the principal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting, as appears by the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle must have left them here when he went to America, which was above fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.<br><br>This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool.* When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of England till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had been outed for nonconformity, holding conventicles* in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church.<br><br>Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more; born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather, in his church history of that country entitled Magnalia Christi Americana, as "a godly, learned Englishman," if I remember the words rightly. I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in 1675, in the homespun verse of that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded from good will, and therefore he would be known to be the author.<br>Because to be a libeler (says he)<br>I hate it with my heart;<br>From Sherburne town,* where now I dwell<br>My name I do put here;<br>Without offense your real friend,<br>It is Peter Folgier.<br>My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was put to the grammar school at eight years of age, my father intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his shorthand volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would learn his character.&nbsp; I continued, however, at the grammar school not quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and further was removed into the next class above it, in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated were afterward able to obtain&#x2014;reasons that he gave to his friends in my hearing&#x2014;altered his first intention, took me from the grammar school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow chandler and soap boiler; a business he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request. Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the shop, going of errands, etc.<br><br>I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my father declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much in and about it, learned early to swim well, and to manage boats; and when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to govern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions I was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into scrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early projecting public spirit, though not then justly conducted.<br><br>There was a salt marsh that bounded part of the millpond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my playfellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets,* sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and, though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.</p><h2>Gutai: Splendid Playground</h2><p>The Gutai Art Association was founded by Yoshihara Jiro in 1954 in the cosmopolite town of Ashiya, near Osaka. The group spanned two generations, totaling 59 artists and is one of the most radical movements in postwar Japanese art history. Published in conjunction with the first United States museum retrospective ever devoted to Gutai, exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, <i>Gutai: Splendid Playground</i> surveys the influential Japanese collective and artistic movement. This exhibition catalogue aims to demonstrate the range of bold and innovative creativity present in the avant-garde movement, to examine the aesthetic strategies in the cultural, social and political context of postwar Japan and the West, and to further establish Gutai in an expanded, transnational history and critical discourse of modern art. Organized thematically and chronologically to explore Gutai&#x2019;s unique approach to materials, concepts, process, performativity and enviroment, this publication investigates the group&#x2019;s radical experimentation across a range of media and styles, and demonstrates how individual artists pushed the limits of what art could be or mean in a post-atomic era. The range includes painting, conceptual art, performance, film, installation art, sound art, interactive art, light art and kinetic art. Illustrating some 120 objects by 25 artists and featuring both iconic Gutai and lesser-known works, <i>Splendid Playground</i> presents a rich survey reflecting new scholarship, especially on &#x201c;late Gutai&#x201d; works dating from 1965 to 1972. The bold and innovative catalogue design reflects the unfettered creativity of Gutai. In addition, an extensive appendix features a selection of Gutai artists&#x2019; writings, an illustrated chronology, artist biographies and a bibliography.</p><p>Founded in 1954 by artist Yoshihara Jiro ... the Gutai Art Association was intended to connect the avant-garde art of Europe, America, and Japan. A collective of young experimental Japanese artists who gleefully disregarded the boundaries circumscribing traditional artworks, Gutai (defined as concreteness) combined painting and sculpture with film, installation, music, performance and communal happenings in exuberantly unorthodox resolutions that still look remarkably fresh. (Lilly Wei <i>Art News</i>)<br><br>Gutai... involved time, action, and performance as it sought a "new autonomous space" and redefined "picturing" as a whole body experience (in the artists' words). The freshness is multiplied when you consider the propriety of Japan's hierarchical traditional culture and decades of oppressive militaristic government. (Janet Koplos <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>The charismatic Yoshihara established Gutai as the most important expressionof Japanese art during the postwar period. (Barbara Pollack <i>Time Out Magazine</i>)<br><br>"a mind-shifting exhibition about Japan's best-known postwar art movement... It displays 100 works of painting, sculpture, drawing, installation art, film and performance, supplemented by photomurals and printed matter, all brilliantly interwoven... Accompanied by a terrific catalog, their effort should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon...Gutai: Splendid Playground" is a breath of fresh air.

But after arriving, she finds that there are those who want to destroy her--and her future. Features a 16-page insert with 30 frontier recipes and home remedies used by characters in the author&#39;s books.</p><p>In this perfect romantic novel a single schoolteacher heads west, falls in love with a rancher and, in the face of forceful opposition, starts a school for Indians. When her best friend also needs a true love, the rancher miraculously produces an identical twin brother. Kate Forbes offers a gentle, delicate reading perfectly suited to the tone of the story. Her soft voice shifts subtly among several dialects and between genders without over-performing any of them. Her schoolteacher is suitably refined, her frontier woman equally feisty. The bad guys are really bad, and the misunderstood bastard shifts from despicable to lovable quite convincingly. By the time the tapes run out, you&#39;re ready, but not a minute before. R.P.L.

This circumstance led Luk�cs, one of the chief Marxist theoreticians of this century, to embark on his exploration of Hegelian antecedents in the German intellectual tradition, their concrete expression in the work of Hegel himself, and later syntheses of seemingly contradictory modes of though. Four phases of Hegel&#39;s intellectual development are examined: &#34;Hegel&#39;s early republican phase,&#34; &#34;the crisis in Hegel&#39;s views on society and the earliest beginnings of his dialectical method,&#34; &#34;rationale and defense of objective idealism,&#34; and &#34;the breach with Schelling and The Phenomenology of Mind.&#34; Luk�cs completed this study in 1938, but because of the imminent outbreak of war, it was not published until the late 1940s. A revised German edition appeared in 1954, and it is this text that is the basis of this first English translation of the work.</p><p>Georg Luk�cs was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher, aesthetician, literary historian, and critic.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Wisdom of the Elements: The Sacred Wheel of Earth, Air, Fire and Water</h2><p>Drawing on her knowledge of neo-pagan tradition, as well as traditional Chinese medicine, energy work with chakras, and Native American wisdom, McArthur provides keys to the intricate correspondences between the Elements, the planet, and our psychic language.</p><p></p><h2>A Bird In Winter: A Children&#39;s Book Inspired by Peter Breugel</h2><p>In this charming children&#x2019;s picture book, Pieter Breugel&#x2019;s painting The Hunters in Snow provides the basis for a heartwarming story about a young girl and the bird she nurses back to health.

He fought throughout his life to connect the labor and civil rights movements, envisioning them as twin pillars for social reform. As we struggle with massive unemployment, a staggering racial wealth gap, and the near collapse of a financial system that puts profits before people, King&#x2019;s prophetic writings and speeches underscore his relevance for today. They help us imagine King anew: as a human rights leader whose commitment to unions and an end to poverty was a crucial part of his civil rights agenda. &nbsp; Covering all the civil rights movement highlights Montgomery, Albany, Birmingham, Selma, Chicago, and Memphis award-winning historian Michael K. Honey introduces and traces King&#x2019;s dream of economic equality. Gathered</p><p><p><b>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</b> (1929-1968), Nobel Peace Prize laureate and architect of the nonviolent civil rights movement, was among the twentieth century's most influential figures. One of the greatest orators in U.S. history, King is the author of several books, including <i>Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story, The Trumpet of Conscience, Why We Can't Wait, </i>and <i>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?</i> His speeches, sermons, and writings are inspirational and timeless.

I need not pause to say how very delighted I am to be here this afternoon and to be some little part of this extremely significant assembly. . . . I don&#x2019;t feel that I come among strangers today for I feel that I&#x2019;m an honorary member of many labor unions all across the country. (Applause) In fact, I think Cleve Robinson and Dave Livingston of District 65 in New York made me an honorary member a long time ago and I&#x2019;ve been a 65er a long time. . . . I want to try to talk very honestly and frankly about this great problem, this great issue that we face as a result of the war in Vietnam. Some of my words may appear to be rather harsh, but they will be as harsh as truth and as gentle as a nonviolent devotee would be. (Laughter) <br> &nbsp;<br> I want to use as a subject &#x201c;The Domestic Impact of the War in America.&#x201d; This question is historic because it is an authentic expression of the conscience of the labor movement. As has been said already this afternoon, tens of millions of Americans oppose the war in Vietnam. Never in our history has there been such a passionate, popular resistance to a current war. In addition to the millions upon millions of ordinary people, eminent scholars, distinguished senators, journalists, businessmen, professionals, students, and political leaders at all levels have protested the war and offered alternatives with an amazing tenacity and boldness. <br> &nbsp;<br> But <i>one </i>voice was missing&#x2014;the loud, clear voice of labor. The absence of that one voice was all the more tragic because it may be the decisive one for tipping the balance toward peace. Labor has been missing. For too long the moral appeal has been flickering, not shining as it did in its dynamic days of growth. This conference, a united expression of varied branches of labor, reaffirms that the trade union movement is part of forward-looking America. (Applause) That no matter what the formal resolutions of higher bodies may be, the troubled conscience of the working people cannot be stilled. This conference speaks for millions. You here today will long be remembered as those who had the courage to speak out and the wisdom to be right. <br> &nbsp;<br> It is noteworthy that the Labor Party of Great Britain, which, of course, has no responsibility for our actions, nonetheless went on record on October 4 in a formal national resolution calling upon its Labor government to dissociate itself completely from U.S. policy in Vietnam. &nbsp;(Applause) It urged its government to persuade the United States to end the bombing of North Vietnam immediately, permanently, and unconditionally. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now what are some of the domestic consequences of the war in Vietnam? It has made the Great Society a myth and replaced it with a troubled and confused society. The war has strengthened domestic reaction. It has given the extreme right, the anti-labor, anti-Negro, and antihumanistic forces a weapon of spurious patriotism to galvanize its supporters into reaching for power, right up to the White House. It hopes to use national frustration to take control and restore the America of social insecurity and power for the privileged. When a Hollywood performer, lacking distinction even as an actor [Ronald Reagan], can become a leading war-hawk candidate for the presidency, only the irrationalities induced by a war psychosis can explain such a melancholy turn of events. (Applause) <br> &nbsp;<br> The war in Vietnam has produced a shameful order of priorities in which the decay, squalor, and pollution of the cities are neglected. And even though 70 percent of our population now lives in them, the war has smothered and nearly extinguished the beginnings of progress toward racial justice. The war has created the bizarre spectacle of armed forces of the United States fighting in ghetto streets in America while they are fighting in jungles in Asia. The war has so increased Negro frustration and despair that urban outbreaks are now an ugly feature of the American scene. How can the administration, with quivering anger, denounce the violence of ghetto Negroes when it has given an example of violence in Asia that shocks the world? (Applause)</p><h2>Rich Diving into the Wreck (Cloth)</h2><p>Author inscribed &#34;For Alice Richman&#34; along with her signature on the title page. The book is in pristine condition!</p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes a National Book Award for poetry for Tonight, No Poetry Will Serve, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant in 1994, and a National Book Award for poetry in 1974 for Diving Into the Wreck. That volume, published in 1973, is considered her masterwork. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s other volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2006, Rich was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.&#x201c;The poet is telling of something now standing before her eyes of which her heart is full. . . . These poems are not loose facts, they are parts of a revelation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Howard, <em>Harper's</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Diving into the Wreck</em> is one of those rare books that force you to decide not just what you think of it, but what you think about yourself. It is a book that takes risks, and forces the reader to take them also. . . . You feel about her best images, her best myths, that nobody else writes quite like this.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Margaret Atwood, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p><h2>Contrarian Investing</h2><p>Explains how independent thinking can lead to potential profits in the market, including advice on the best percentage of a portfolio to place in each stock, the single best buy signal, and rules for knowing when to sell</p><p>The stock market may be the only exchange in which buyers rush in when prices are raised and stand back warily when prices are marked down. The few investors able to resist this herd psychology are called contrarians; they buy and sell when others won&#39;t. Anthony M. Gallea, a Senior Portfolio Management Director, and William Patalon III, a newspaper reporter, have written a guide for those who aim to join the contrarians&#39; lonely ranks. The authors&#39; first rule is never to buy a stock unless its price has dropped at least 50 percent from its 52-week high. Following this rule would have meant missing out on a lot of the fun during the 1990s, but it may serve investors well if the market&#39;s momentum stalls.</p><h2>Indian in the Cupboard: Mystery of the Cupboard, Secret of the Indian, Return of the Indian</h2><p>Titles include mass market editions of The Indian in the Cupboard, The Reutrn of the Indian, The Secret of the Indian and The Mystery of the Cupboard.</p><p>What could be better than a magic cupboard that turns small toys into living creatures? Omri's big brother has no birthday present for him, so he gives Omri an old medicine cabinet he's found. Although their mother supplies a key, the cabinet still doesn't seem like much of a present. But when an exhausted Omri dumps a plastic toy Indian into the cabinet just before falling asleep, the magic begins. Turn the key once and the toy comes alive; turn it a second time and it's an action figure again. <p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is one of those rare books that is equally appealing to children and adults. The story of Omri and the Indian, Little Bear, is replete with subtle reminders of the responsibilities that accompany friendship and love. For kids, it's a great yarn; for most parents, it's also a reminder that Omri's wrenching decision to send his toy back to its own world is not so different from the recognition of their children's emerging independence. </p><p> <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i> is also available in Spanish (<i>La Llave Magica</i>.)

He's known as Green Jack, Puck, the Green Knight, Pan, Robin Hood, and the Jolly Green Giant, and likely many more names lost in the mists of time. <i>The Green Man</i> is an ancient symbol of nature and fertility and wildness, whose leafy image can be seen today on buildings and in artwork from various cultures all over the world. This gift box is a wonderful introduction to the Green Man and all that he represents. With 25 full-color images from throughout the ages and across cultures, the book traces the many strands of the legend - from the first agrarian people of the ancient world to our own time when the Green Man has become an unofficial icon for the environmental movement. A uniquely crafted plaque depicting the Green Man in his benign guise completes the package. The plaque was specially designed for this kit and will provide a whimsical touch of nature in the garden, on the patio, or in any room in the house.</p></p><p>John Matthews has been studying the Celtic tradition for over thirty years.

Farmer Brown finds another note on the barn door: "Sorry. We're closed. No milk today."

The author of over 1,000 articles and numerous books, she has lectured widely to law-enforcement schools and agencies. She has also serves as a consultant to the FBI&#x2019;s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VI-CAP), which is used to track and apprehend violent criminals. Her bestselling books, <b>Lust Killer, The Want-Ad Killer, The I-5 Killer</b>, and <b>Small Sacrifices</b>, are available in Signet editions.This searching analysis of the shooting of three children in Oregon by their mother devolves into a study of personality. In May of 1983, Diane Downs drove to a Williamette Valley hospital emergency room with her children, all gravely wounded; one did not survive the first hour, and the other two were disabled for life. Downs initially told of a "bushy-haired stranger" who had committed the crime, but frequently changed her story. Under police questioning she recalled her childhood with a cold, domineering father who abused her sexually, her weak mother, a rape by one of her bosses, her failed marriage and many men with whom she had sex. One of these men, whom she claimed to love, did not want children, and that may have prompted the crime, speculates the author. The greatest strength of this book is the exploration by ex-policewoman Rule (The Stranger Beside Me of the aberrant personality of Downs, who is now imprisoned and not eligible for parole until 2009. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>West With the Night</h2><p>Beryl Markham moved to Kenya with her father at the age of four and stayed until her death in 1986. Her incredible autobiography describes the Africa she learnt to love: her childhood surrounded by the tribal people, her tangles - often nearly fatal - with its wild animals and her passions for racehorses and aeroplanes.<br>Markham achieved notoriety and success as a horse trainer when one of her horses won the most prestigious race in Kenya. She turned her hand to aeroplanes with Denys Finch Hatton, the lover of Karen Blixen, as a teacher and became the first woman in Kenya to receive a commercial pilot's licence. Her adventures and courageous career as a bush pilot are recounted in vivid detail here, along with the richness and fascination of life in Kenya in the twenties and thirties.</p><p>One of the most beautifully crafted books I have ever read, with some of the most poetic prose passages I could imagine, such as the following, resonating with a stately and timeless quality so absent in our modern life: <blockquote> There are all kinds of silences and each of them means a different thing. There is the silence that comes with morning in a forest, and this is different from the silence of a sleeping city. There is silence after a rainstorm, and before a rainstorm, and these are not the same. There is the silence of emptiness, the silence of fear, the silence of doubt. There is a certain silence that can emanate from a lifeless object as from a chair lately used, or from a piano with old dust upon its keys, or from anything that has answered to the need of a man, for pleasure or for work. This kind of silence can speak. Its voice may be melancholy, but it is not always so; for the chair may have been left by a laughing child or the last notes of the piano may have been raucous and gay. Whatever the mood or the circumstance, the essence of its quality may linger in the silence that follows. It is a soundless echo. </blockquote> Born in England in 1902, Markham was taken by her father to East Africa in 1906. She spent her childhood playing with native Maruni children and apprenticing with her father as a trainer and breeder of racehorses. In the 1930s, she became an African bush pilot, and in September 1936, became the first person to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west.Born in England in 1902, Markham grew up in East Africa.

The firm he chose was small, but-well respected. They were prepared to match, and then exceed Mitch&#39;s wildest dreams: eighty thousand a year, a BMW and a low-interest mortgage. Now the house, the car and the job are his. Then the nightmares begin: the secret files, the bugs in the new bedroom, the mysterious deaths of colleagues, and the millions of dollars of mob money pouring through the office into the Cayman Islands, dollars that the FBI would do anything to trace. Now Mitch is in the place where dreams end and nightmares begin...</p><p>D.W. Moffett uses his youthful voice to outstanding effect in this excellent abridgment of Grisham's bestselling thriller about a Harvard Law grad aggressively recruited by a curiously obscure firm. "We're small and very selective... we screened over two thousand third-year law students at the best schools. Only one letter was sent." They've decided he's their man and to get him they offer top dollar, dangle a BMW, and woo his wife with offers impossible to refuse. But as the wide-eyed youngsters soon discover, there's a catch. Moffett gives an excellent performance, bringing the story to life with vibrant and believable characterizations and a smooth, knowing narrative.

Published by Dog Ear Publishing,2008, Binding: Paperback</p><p>Here's what's in the book... <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 1</strong>&nbsp;<em>"What the Heck is Plantar Fasciitis?"</em>&nbsp;will tell you what the plantar fascia is, where it is, what it's made of, and what it does. &nbsp;Did you know the plantar fascia actually consists of <em>three</em> distinct parts? &nbsp;(Be sure your treatment is directed at the most important one!) &nbsp;Did you know the plantar fascia works to support your arch through the windlass mechanism? Also in this chapter, you will learn that there is NO inflammation in your foot when you have plantar fasciitis. &nbsp;Hard to believe? &nbsp;Not after you read my summary of all the published studies that have taken a piece of the plantar fascia from sufferers and examined it under a microscope. <br><br> So if they don't find any inflammation, then what do they find? You'll know exactly after reading this chapter. No wonder treatments aimed at getting rid of inflammation don't work for long... </li></ul> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 2</strong>&nbsp;<em>"How Long Does Plantar Fasciitis Last?"</em>&nbsp;discusses the natural history of plantar fasciitis, in other words, how long does it usually last if we don't treat it OR if we treat it conservatively? Readers will be interested to know, that in many cases, plantar fasciitis gets better on it's own, in time, regardless of how it's treated. So how long does it normally last? &nbsp;This chapter will tell you.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 3 </strong>is titled&nbsp;<em>"The 5-Minute Plantar Fasciitis Solution". &nbsp;</em>So if it&nbsp;is true that most people with plantar fasciitis gets better no matter how you treat it, why do we need a 5-Minute Plantar Fasciitis Solution?&nbsp;Well, while&nbsp;the majority of people with plantar fasciitis do indeed get better in time,&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em><em>everyone does. </em>Luckily, however, controlled studies show that for long-term sufferers (3 years or more) some treatments work better than others - like the 5-Minute Plantar Fasciitis Solution! With it taking a mere five minutes a day to do, and having shown to have a 94% success rate in randomized controlled trials, its <em>well</em> worth a try! And if it doesn't work - simply return the book!</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 4</strong>&nbsp;is titled<em>"Measuring Your Progress"</em>. Here you'll learn what changes to look out for as your plantar fasciitis gets better - sometimes it's hard to see progress when your foot has been hurting for so long. &nbsp;Included is a quick test you can take once a week to track the progress of your now healing plantar fascia.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 5</strong>&nbsp;is called&nbsp;<em>"How to Keep Plantar Fasciitis From Ever Coming Back". &nbsp;</em>After your plantar fasciitis is gone, you'll want to do what you can to keep from getting it again - which is the whole purpose of this chapter. &nbsp;It's here the book discusses the risk factors for plantar fasciitis. For example, having an inflexible ankle can increase your chances of getting plantar fasciitis. &nbsp;No need to worry though, the book will show you two stretches to make your ankle more flexible, tell you exactly how long to hold the stretch, and how many times a day you need to do it. &nbsp;Problem solved!&nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 6</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>"Other Options for Eliminating Plantar Fasciitis"</em>.&nbsp;While the book centers around a five minute home program that has been clinically shown to be 94% successful at decreasing pain in people who suffer from chronic plantar fasciitis, the fact of the matter is that NO treatment works for everyone, all the time. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to provide the reader with a list of alternative treatments to consider that have been tested in published controlled trials.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Chapter 7</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>"Putting It All Together". &nbsp;</em>This is the last chapter in the book and summarizes all the principles in the book. While the&nbsp;5-Minute Plantar Fasciitis Solution is effective in the majority of cases, it can't help you if you don't do it. To help keep you consistent from day-to-day, I've included an 8-week exercise log to chart your progress.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>At a mere 86 pages, this book is written in a large font and non-medical language. It's goal is that the reader suffering from plantar fasciitis can put this concise book down in about 2-3 hours time, and have all the knowledge and tools they need to eliminate this most painful foot condition - and keep it from ever coming back!</li> </ul><b>From the Inside Flap</b></p><h2>The Perfect Suspect (Catherine McLeod Mysteries, No. 2)</h2><p><b>A new Catherine McLeod mystery from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Wind River mysteries. </b><p>After a candidate for governor is murdered, and his estranged wife is arrested for first-degree homicide, journalist Catherine McLeod receives a call from an anonymous woman claiming she saw the real killer leave the scene of the crime but is afraid to confide in the police.

Four of his books have been shortlisted for the Bram Stoker Award, which he won in 2001 with THE TRAVELLING VAMPIRE SHOW.

He died in February 2001.One of the authors most affected by the domestic turndown in the horror market in the 1990s is Laymon, who published many novels, mostly mass market, here in the '80s. He remains popular in the U.K. and Australia, with new books appearing there regularly, but his fiction has for the most part gone out of print in the U.S. So kudos to Cemetery Dance for bringing his new novel, a sequel to The Cellar and The Beast House, to American readers. It's classic Laymon, which means that it's full of titillating sex and violence aimed at the teenager in us all, but also that it's constructed in stripped-down prose that spits across the page and is rife with strong characters traced in deft strokes. Laymon expertly seeds the backstory?of the notorious house in a small California town, site of numerous savagings by an unknown species of sexually ravenous, humanoid "beasts"?throughout the narrative, which follows the liaisons and perils of a woman raped decades ago by a beast, and of several guides and tourists around the house, now a tourist attraction. A copulating couple is buried alive; Peeping Toms spy on three bathing beauties; a woman is raped, then handcuffed in a cellar tunnel?and so on in Laymon's lurid tale, which speeds steadily toward a bloody climax, the eponymous tour of the Beast House, and a merciless conclusion.

The only common strand in the struggles which Germany and Japan unleashed was that they chose most of the same adversaries. The only important people who sought to conduct the eastern and western conflicts as a unified enterprise were Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and their respective chiefs of staff. After the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor caused the United States to become a belligerent, Allied warlords addressed the vexed issue of allocating resources to rival theatres. Germany was by far the Allies&#x2019; more dangerous enemy, while Japan was the focus of greater American animus. In 1942, at the battles of the Coral Sea in May and Midway a month later, the U.S. Navy won victories which halted the Japanese advance across the Pacific, and removed the danger that Australia might be invaded.<br><br>Through the two years which followed, America&#x2019;s navy grew in strength, while her Marines and soldiers slowly and painfully expelled the Japanese from the island strongholds which they had seized. But President Roosevelt and Gen. George Marshall, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, resisted the demands of Admiral Ernest King, the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s C-in-C, and of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander in the south-west Pacific, for the eastern theatre to become the principal focus of America&#x2019;s war effort. In 1943 and 1944, America&#x2019;s vast industrial mobilisation made it possible to send large forces of warships and planes east as well as west. Most U.S. ground troops, however, were dispatched across the Atlantic, to fight the Germans. Once Japan&#x2019;s onslaught was checked, the Allies&#x2019; eastern commanders were given enough forces progressively to push back the enemy, but insufficient to pursue a swift victory. The second-class status of the Japanese war was a source of resentment to those who had to fight it, but represented strategic wisdom.<br><br>The U.S. and Britain dispatched separate companies to Europe and Asia, to perform in different plays. Stalin, meanwhile, was interested in the conflict with Japan only insofar as it might offer opportunities to amass booty. &#x201c;The Russians may be expected to move against the Japanese when it suits their pleasure,&#x201d; suggested an American diplomat in an October 1943 memorandum to the State Department, &#x201c;which may not be until the final phases of the war&#x2014;and then only in order to be able to participate in dictating terms to the Japanese and to establish new strategic frontiers.&#x201d; Until 8 August 1945, Soviet neutrality in the east was so scrupulously preserved that American B-29s which forced-landed on Russian territory had to stay there, not least to enable their hosts to copy the design.<br><br>To soldiers, sailors and airmen, any battlefield beyond their own compass seemed remote. &#x201c;What was happening in Europe really didn&#x2019;t matter to us,&#x201d; said Lt. John Cameron-Hayes of 23rd Indian Mountain Artillery, fighting in Burma. More surprising was the failure of Germany and Japan to coordinate their war efforts, even to the limited extent that geographical separation might have permitted. These two nominal allies, whose fortunes became conjoined in December 1941, conducted operations in almost absolute isolation from each other. Hitler had no wish for Asians to meddle in his Aryan war. Indeed, despite Himmler&#x2019;s best efforts to prove that Japanese possessed some Aryan blood, he remained embarrassed by the association of the Nazi cause with <i>Untermenschen</i>. He received the Japanese ambassador in Berlin twice after Pearl Harbor, then not for a year. When Tokyo in 1942 proposed an assault on Madagascar, the German navy opposed any infringement of the two allies&#x2019; agreed spheres of operations, divided at 70 degrees of longitude.<br><br>A Japanese assault on the Soviet Union in 1941&#x2013;42, taking the Russians in the rear as they struggled to stem Hitler&#x2019;s invasion, might have yielded important rewards for the Axis. Stalin was terrified of such an eventuality. The July 1941 oil embargo and asset freeze imposed by the U.S. on Japan&#x2014;Roosevelt&#x2019;s clumsiest diplomatic act in the months before Pearl Harbor&#x2014;was partly designed to deter Tokyo from joining Hitler&#x2019;s Operation Barbarossa. Japan&#x2019;s bellicose foreign minister, Yosuke Matsuoka, resigned in the same month because his government rejected his urgings to do so.<br><br>Only in January 1943, towards the end of the disaster of Stalingrad, did Hitler made a belated and unsuccessful attempt to persuade Japan to join his Russian war. By then, the moment had passed at which such an intervention might have altered history. Germany&#x2019;s Asian ally was far too heavily committed in the Pacific, South-East Asia and China, gratuitously to engage a new adversary. So perfunctory was Berlin&#x2019;s relationship with Tokyo that when Hitler gifted to his ally two state- of-the-art U-boats for reproduction, German manufacturers complained about breaches of their patent rights. One of Japan&#x2019;s most serious deficiencies in 1944&#x2013;45 was lack of a portable anti-tank weapon, but no attempt was made to copy the cheap and excellent German <i>Panzerfaust</i>.<br><br>Japan and Germany were alike fascistic states. Michael Howard has written: &#x201c;Both [nations&#x2019;] programmes were fuelled by a militarist ideology that rejected the bourgeois liberalism of the capitalist West and glorified war as the inevitable and necessary destiny of mankind.&#x201d; The common German and Japanese commitment to making war for its own sake provides the best reason for rejecting pleas in mitigation of either nation&#x2019;s conduct. The two Axis partners, however, pursued unrelated ambitions. The only obvious manifestation of shared interest was that Japanese planning was rooted in an assumption of German victory. Like Italy in June 1940, Japan in December 1941 decided that the old colonial powers&#x2019; difficulties in Europe exposed their remoter properties to rapine. Japan sought to seize access to vital oil and raw materials, together with space for mass migration from the home islands.<br><br>A U.S. historian has written of Japan&#x2019;s <i>Daitoa Senso</i>, Greater East Asian War: &#x201c;Japan did not invade independent countries in southern Asia. It invaded colonial outposts which Westerners had dominated for generations, taking absolutely for granted their racial and cultural superiority over their Asian subjects.&#x201d; This is true as far as it goes. Yet Japan&#x2019;s seizures of British, Dutch, French and American possessions must surely be seen in the context of its earlier aggression in China, where for a decade its armies had flaunted their ruthlessness towards fellow Asians. After seizing Manchuria in 1931, the Japanese in 1937 began their piecemeal pillage of China, which continued until 1945.<br><br>Inaugurating its &#x201c;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,&#x201d; Japan perceived itself merely as a latecomer to the contests for empire in which other great nations had engaged for centuries. It saw only hypocrisy and racism in the objections of Western imperial powers to its bid to match their own generous interpretations of what constituted legitimate overseas interests. Such a view was not completely baseless. Japan&#x2019;s pre-war economic difficulties and pretensions to a policy of &#x201c;Asia for Asians&#x201d; inspired some sympathy among subject peoples of the European empires. This vanished, however, in the face of the occupiers&#x2019; behaviour in China and elsewhere. Japanese pogroms of Chinese in South-East Asia were designed partly to win favour with indigenous peoples, but these in turn soon found themselves suffering appallingly. The new rulers were inhibited from treating their conquests humanely, even had they wished to do so, by the fact that the purpose of seizure was to strip them of food and raw materials for the benefit of Japan&#x2019;s people. Western audiences have been told much since 1945 about Japanese wartime inhumanity to British, Americans and Australians who fell into their hands. This pales into absolute insignificance beside the scale of their mistreatment of Asians.<br><br>It is a fascinating speculation, how events might have evolved if the U.S. and its Philippines dependency had been excluded from Japanese war plans in December 1941; had Tokyo confined itself to occupying British Malaya and Burma, along with the Dutch East Indies. Roosevelt would certainly have wished to confront Japanese aggression and enter the war&#x2014;the oil embargo imposed by the U.S. following Japan&#x2019;s advance into Indochina was the tipping factor in deciding Tokyo to fight the Western powers. It remains a moot point, however, whether Congress and public sentiment would have allowed the president to declare war in the absence of a direct assault on American national interests or the subsequent German declaration of war on the U.S.<br><br>There was once a popular delusion that Japan&#x2019;s attack smashed the American Pacific Fleet. In truth, however, the six old battleships disabled at Pearl Harbor&#x2014;all but one was subsequently restored for war service by brilliantly ingenious repair techniques&#x2014;mattered much less to the balance of forces than the four American aircraft carriers, oil stocks and dockyard facilities which escaped. Japan paid a wholly disproportionate moral price for a modest, if spectacular, tactical success. The &#x201c;Day of Infamy&#x201d; roused the American people as no lesser provocation could have done. The operation must thus be judged a failure, rendering hollow the exultation of the Imperial Navy&#x2019;s fliers as they landed back on their carriers on 7 December 1941. Thereafter, Americans were united in determination to avenge themselves on the treacherous Asians who had assaulted a peace-loving people.<br><br>The only important strategic judgement which the Japanese got right was that their fate hinged upon that of Hitler. German victory was the sole eventuality which might have saved Japan from the consequences of assaulting powers vastly superior to itself in military and industrial potential. Col. Masanobu Tsuji, architect of the Japanese army&#x2019;s capture of Singapore and a fanatical advocate of national expansion, said: &#x201c;We honestly believed that America, a nation of storekeepers, would not persist with a loss-making war, whereas Japan could sustain a protracted campaign against the Anglo-Saxons.&#x201d; Tokyo&#x2019;s greatest misjudgement of all was to perceive its assault as an act of policy which might be reviewed in the light of events. In December 1941 Japan gambled on a short war, swift victory, and acceptance of terms by the vanquished. Even in August 1945, many Japanese leaders refused to acknowledge that the terms of reference for the struggle ceased to be theirs to determine on the day of Pearl Harbor. It was wildly fanciful to suppose that the consequences of military failure might be mitigated through diplomatic parley. By choosing to participate in a total war, the nation exposed itself to total defeat.<br><br>Although the loss of Hong Kong, Malaya and Burma in 1941&#x2013;42 inflicted on Britain humiliations to match those suffered at Japanese hands by the U.S., its people cared relatively little about the Far Eastern war, a source of dismay to British soldiers obliged to fight in it. Winston Churchill was tormented by a desire to redeem the defeat in February 1942 of some 70,000 combat troops under British command by a force of 35,000 Japanese. &#x201c;The shame of our disaster at Singapore could . . . only be wiped out by our recapture of that fortress,&#x201d; he told the British chiefs of staff as late as 6 July 1944, in one of his many&#x2014;fortunately frustrated&#x2014;attempts to allow this objective to determine eastern strategy.<br><br>To the British public, however, the Asian war seemed remote. The Japanese character in the BBC&#x2019;s legendary <i>ITMA</i> radio comedy show was Hari Kari, a gabbling clown. In June 1943 the Secretary of State for India, Leo Amery, proposed forming a committee to rouse the British public against its Asian enemies. The Minister of Information, Brendan Bracken, strongly dissented:<br><br>"It is all very well to say &#x201c;We must educate the British public to regard the Japanese as if they were Germans, and war in the Pacific as if it were war in Europe.&#x201d; But, while the Japanese remain many thousands of miles away, the Germans have for three years been only twenty miles distant from our shore and, too often, vertically overhead. Interest and feeling follow where friends and loved ones are fighting . . . Europe is very much a home concern, whereas knowledge of or interest in the Far East is sparsely distributed in this country . . . I do not think that any committee could do much to alter &#x201c;the state of morale&#x201d; . . . The people have been left under no misapprehension by the PM that it is their duty to turn and tackle Japan when the time comes . . ."<br><br>Those Britons who did think about the Japanese shared American revulsion towards them. When reports were broadcast in early 1944 of the maltreatment of prisoners, an editorial in the <i>Daily Mail</i> proclaimed: &#x201c;The Japanese have proved a sub-human race . . . Let us resolve to outlaw them. When they are beaten back to their own savage land, let them live there in complete isolation from the rest of the world, as in a leper compound, unclean.&#x201d; The American historian John Dower explains Western attitudes in racist terms. U.S. Admiral William Halsey set the tone after Pearl Harbor, asserting that when the war was over, &#x201c;Japanese will be spoken only in hell.&#x201d; A U.S. War Department film promoting bond sales employed the slogan: &#x201c;Every War Bond Kills a Jap.&#x201d; An American sub-machine gun manufacturer advertised its products as &#x201c;blasting big red holes in little yellow men.&#x201d; There was no counterpart on the European fronts to the commonplace Pacific practices of drying and preserving Japanese skulls as souvenirs, and sending home to loved ones polished bones of enemy dead. A British brigade commander in Burma once declined to accept a report from the 4/1st Gurkhas about the proximity of &#x201c;Nips.&#x201d; Their colonel, Derek Horsford, dispatched a patrol to gather evidence. Next day, Horsford left three Japanese heads, hung for convenience on a string, beside his commander&#x2019;s desk. The brigadier said: &#x201c;Never do that again. Next time, I&#x2019;ll take your word for it.&#x201d;<br><br>But those who argue that the alien appearance and culture of the Japanese generated unique hatred and savagery seem to give insufficient weight to the fact that the Japanese initiated and institutionalised barbarism towards both civilians and prisoners. True, the Allies later responded in kind. But in an imperfect world, it seems unrealistic to expect that any combatant in a war will grant adversaries conspicuously better treatment than his own people receive at their hands. Years ahead of Pearl Harbor Japanese massacres of Chinese civilians were receiving worldwide publicity. Tokyo&#x2019;s forces committed systemic brutalities against Allied prisoners and civilians in the Philippines, East Indies, Hong Kong and Malaya&#x2014;for instance, the slaughter of Chinese outside Singapore in February 1942&#x2014;long before the first Allied atrocity against any Japanese is recorded.<br><br>The consequence of so-called Japanese fanaticism on the battlefield, of which much more later, was that Allied commanders favoured the use of extreme methods to defeat them. As an example, the Japanese rejected the convention customary in Western wars, whereby if a military position became untenable, its defenders gave up. In August 1944, when German prisoners were arriving in the United States at the rate of 50,000 a month, after three years of the war only 1,990 Japanese prisoners reposed in American hands. Why, demanded Allied commanders, should their men be obliged to risk their own lives in order to indulge the enemy&#x2019;s inhuman doctrine of mutual immolation?<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Inimitable Jeeves (Everyman&#39;s Library P G WODEHOUSE)</h2><p>The Inimitable Jeeves (Everyman&#39;s Library P G WODEHOUSE)</p><p>When Bingo Little falls in love at a Camberwell subscription dance and Bertie Wooster drops into the mulligatawny, there's work for a wet-nurse.

Dense urban living has been prescribed as a panacea for the environmental and resource crises of our time. But is it better or worse for our happiness? Are subways, sidewalks, and tower dwelling an improvement on the car-dependence of sprawl?</p><p>The award-winning journalist Charles Montgomery finds answers to such questions at the intersection between urban design and the emerging science of happiness, and during an exhilarating journey through some of the world's most dynamic</p><p>cities. He meets the visionary mayor who introduced a "sexy" lipstick-red bus to ease status anxiety in Bogot�; the architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan hill towns to modern-day New York City; the activist who turned Paris's urban freeways into beaches; and an army of American suburbanites who have transformed their lives by hacking the design of their streets and neighborhoods.</p><p>Full of rich historical detail and new insights from psychologists and Montgomery's own urban experiments, <i>Happy</i><i> City</i> is an essential tool for understanding and improving our own communities. The message is as surprising as it is hopeful: by retrofitting our cities for happiness, we can tackle the urgent challenges of our age. The happy city, the green city, and the low-carbon city are the same place, and we can all help build it.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Montgomery</b> is an award-winning journalist and the author of <i>The Shark God</i>, which won the 2005 Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-Fiction under its Canadian</p><p>title, <i>The Last Heathen</i>.</p>1. The Mayor of Happy <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>There is a myth, sometimes widespread, that a person need only do inner work, in order to be alive like this; that a man is entirely responsible for his own problems; and that to cure himself, he need only change himself&nbsp;&#x2026; The fact is, a person is so far formed by his surroundings, that his state of harmony depends entirely on his harmony with his surroundings. <br>&#x2014;Christopher Alexander, <i>The Timeless Way of Building</i> <br>I chased the politician through the bowels of a dull cement office block on the edge of a twelve-lane freeway. Everything about him suggested urgency. He hollered with the hurried fervor of a preacher. He wore the kind of close-trimmed beard favored by men who don&#x2019;t like to waste time shaving. He jogged through the building&#x2019;s basement parking deck in a long-legged canter, like a center forward charging for a long pass. <br>Two bodyguards trotted behind him, their pistols jostling in holsters. There was nothing remarkable about that, given his profession&#x2014;and his locale. Enrique Pe�alosa was a perennial politician on yet another campaign, and this was Bogot�, a city with a spectacular reputation for kidnappings and assassination. What was unusual was this: Pe�alosa didn&#x2019;t climb into the armored SUV typical of most public figures in Colombia. Instead, he hopped on a knobby-tired mountain bike and quickly cranked his way up a ramp into the searing Andean sunlight. Then he was off, jumping curbs and potholes, riding one-handed, weaving across the pavement, and barking into his cell phone while his pin-striped trousers flapped in the breeze. His bodyguards, a photographer, and I all pedaled madly behind, like a throng of teenagers in the wake of a rock star. <br>A few years earlier, this ride would have been a radical and&#x2014;in the opinion of many Bogotanos&#x2014;suicidal act. If you wanted to be assaulted, asphyxiated by exhaust, or run over, Bogot�&#x2019;s streets were the place to be. But now it was 2007, and Pe�alosa insisted that things had changed. We would be safe. The city had gotten happier, thanks to his plan. <i>Happier</i>&#x2014;that was the word he used over and over again, as though he owned it. <br>Young women giggled as he passed. Overall-clad laborers waved. <br>&#x201c;Mayor! Mayor!&#x201d; a few of them shouted in Spanish, though it had been six years since Pe�alosa had held that job, and his campaign to regain it had barely begun. He waved back with his phone hand. <br> <i>&#x201c;Buenos d�as, hermosa!&#x201d;</i> he said to the girls. <br> <i>&#x201c;�C�mo le va?&#x201d;</i> he answered the men. <br> <i>&#x201c;Hola, amigo!&#x201d;</i> he offered to anyone who looked his way. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re living an experiment,&#x201d; he finally yelled back at me as he pocketed his cell phone. &#x201c;We might not be able to fix the economy. We might not be able to make everyone as rich as Americans. But we can design the city to give people dignity, to make them <i>feel</i> rich. The city can make them happier.&#x201d; <br>There it was, the declaration I have seen bring tears to so many eyes with its promise of urban revolution and redemption. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>It&#x2019;s been six years since my ride with the Mayor of Happy, but the memory has remained with me, as vivid as the Andean sun. That was the day the journey began. <br>You may never have heard of Enrique Pe�alosa. You may not have been among the crowds that gave him a hero&#x2019;s welcome in New York, Los Angeles, Singapore, Lagos, or Mexico City over the last decade. You may never have seen him raise his arms like an evangelist or holler his philosophy over the noise of a hundred idling car engines. But his grand experiment and his even grander rhetoric inspire an urbanist fervor wherever he goes. Pe�alosa has become one of the central figures in a movement that is changing the structure and soul of cities around the world. <br>I first saw Pe�alosa work his rhetorical magic back in the spring of 2006. The United Nations had just announced that some day in the following months, one more child would be born in an urban hospital or a migrant would stumble into a metropolitan shantytown, and from that moment on, more than half the world&#x2019;s people would be living in cities. Hundreds of millions more were on their way. By 2030 almost five billion of us will be urban. That spring, Habitat, the UN&#x2019;s agency for human settlements, called thousands of mayors, engineers, bureaucrats, and do-gooders together for the World Urban Forum. The delegates met in a harborside convention center in Vancouver to figure out how to save the world&#x2019;s exploding cities from disaster. <br>The world had little inkling of the great recession slouching on the horizon, yet the prognosis was bleak. The problem? On the one hand, cities were pumping out most of the world&#x2019;s pollution and 80 percent of humanity&#x2019;s greenhouse gas emissions. On the other, all predictions suggested that cities were going to be slammed by the effects of climate change, from heat waves and water scarcity to waves of migrants running from droughts, floods, and water wars. The experts agreed that cities would bear more than three-quarters of the cost of adapting to global warming. They would be short on energy, tax revenue, and jobs. There seemed to be no way they were going to be able to help citizens meet the goals of security and prosperity that urbanization had always seemed to promise. The gathering was sobering. <br>But the mood changed when Pe�alosa took the podium. He told the mayors that there was hope, that the great migration was not a threat&#x2014;no!&#x2014;it was a tremendous opportunity to reinvent urban life. As poor cities doubled or tripled in size, they could avoid the mistakes that rich cities had made. They could offer their citizens lives that were better, stronger, freer, and more joyful than those offered by most cities of the day. But to accomplish this, they would have to completely rethink their beliefs about what cities are for. They would have to let go of a century of thought about city building. They would have to let go of some of their dreams. <br>To make his point, Pe�alosa told a story. <br>Toward the end of the twentieth century, Bogot� had become a truly horrible place to live&#x2014;one of the very worst on earth. Overwhelmed with refugees; seared by a decades-old civil war and sporadic terrorism in the form of grenades and firebombs (deadly &#x201c;explosive potatoes&#x201d; being the most common means of attack); and hobbled by traffic, pollution, poverty, and dysfunction, the Colombian capital was regarded both at home and abroad as a living hell. <br>When Pe�alosa ran for the mayor&#x2019;s seat back in 1997, he refused to make the promises doled out by so many politicians. He was not going to make everyone richer. Forget the dream of becoming as wealthy as Americans: it would take generations to catch up to the gringos, even if the urban economy caught fire and burned blue for a century. The dream of riches, Pe�alosa complained, served only to make Bogotans feel bad. <br>&#x201c;If we defined our success just in terms of income per capita, we would have to accept ourselves as second- or third-rate societies&#x2014;as a bunch of <i>losers</i>,&#x201d; he said. No, the city needed a new goal. Pe�alosa promised neither a car in every garage nor a socialist revolution. His promise was simple. He was going to make Bogotans happier. <br>&#x201c;And what are our needs for happiness?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;We need to walk, just as birds need to fly. We need to be around other people. We need beauty. We need contact with nature. And most of all, we need not to be excluded. We need to feel some sort of equality.&#x201d; <br>Ironically, in giving up the chase for the American dream, Pe�alosa was invoking a goal set out in the American Constitution: by pursuing a different kind of happiness, Bogotans, despite their relatively meager paychecks, really could beat the gringos. <br>These days, the world is not lacking for happiness gurus. Some insist that spiritual practice is the answer. Others tell us that we must simply ask the universe for prosperity, that we can get closer to God by getting richer, and get richer by inching closer to God. But Pe�alosa did not call for mass counseling or religious indoctrination or state-funded courses in positive psychology. He did not preach the law of attraction or the tenets of transformative wealth. This was a gospel of transformative urbanism. The city itself could be a device for happiness. Life could be improved, even amid economic doldrums, by changing the shapes and systems that defined urban existence. <br>Pe�alosa attributed an almost transcendent power to a certain kind of urbanity. &#x201c;Most things that people buy in stores give them a lot of satisfaction the moment they buy them,&#x201d; Pe�alosa told me. &#x201c;But after a few days, that satisfaction decreases, and months later, it completely melts away. But great public space is a kind of magical good. It never ceases to yield happiness. It&#x2019;s almost happiness itself.&#x201d; The humble sidewalk, the park, the bike path, and the bus were suddenly elevated to the psycho-spiritual realm. <br>Pe�alosa insisted that like most cities, Bogot� had been left deeply wounded by the twentieth century&#x2019;s dual urban legacy: First, the city had been gradually reoriented around private automobiles. Second, public spaces and resources had largely been privatized. Cars and mobile vendors took over public plazas and sidewalks. People had walled or fenced in what were once public parks. In an age where even most of the poor had televisions, common civic space was disregarded and degraded. <br>This reorganization was both unfair&#x2014;only one in five families even owned a car&#x2014;and cruel. Urban residents had been denied the opportunity to enjoy the city&#x2019;s simplest daily pleasures: walking on convivial streets; sitting around in public; talking; gazing at grass, water, falling leaves, and other people. And playing: children had largely disappeared from Bogot�&#x2019;s streets&#x2014;not because of the fear of gunfire or abduction, but because the streets had been rendered dangerous by sheer speed. When any parent shouted, &#x201c;Watch out!&#x201d; everyone in Bogot� knew that a child was in danger of being run over. So Pe�alosa&#x2019;s first and most defining act as mayor was to declare war: not on crime or drugs or poverty, but on private cars. <br>&#x201c;A city can be friendly to people or it can be friendly to cars, but it can&#x2019;t be both,&#x201d; he announced. <br>He then threw out the city&#x2019;s ambitious highway expansion plan and instead poured his budget into hundreds of miles of bike paths; a vast new chain of parks and pedestrian plazas; and a network of new libraries, schools, and day-care centers. He built the city&#x2019;s first rapid transit system, using buses instead of trains. He hiked gas taxes and banned drivers from commuting by car more than three times a week. I&#x2019;ll discuss the details later, but the thing to understand here is that this program redesigned the experience of city living for millions of people, and it was an utter rejection of the philosophies that have guided city builders around the world for more than half a century. It was the opposite of the city that North American laws, habits, the real estate industry, financing arrangements, and development ideologies have favored. In particular, it was the opposite of the vision that millions of middle-class people around the world have chased to suburbia. <br>In the third year of his term Pe�alosa challenged Bogotans to participate in an experiment, a <i>d�a sin carro.</i> As of dawn on February 24, 2000, all private cars were banned from city streets for the day. More than eight hundred thousand vehicles sat still that Thursday. Buses were jam-packed and taxis hard to come by, but hundreds of thousands of people followed Pe�alosa&#x2019;s example and hit the streets under their own steam, walking, cycling, skating to work and school. <br>It was the first day in four years that nobody was killed in traffic. Hospital admissions fell by almost a third. The toxic haze over the city thinned. People still got to work, and schools reported normal attendance. Bogotans enjoyed the day so much that they voted to make it a yearly affair, and to ban all private cars during rush hour <i>every day</i> by 2015. People told pollsters that they were more optimistic about city life than they had been in years. <br>Pe�alosa recounts this story with all the fervor of Martin Luther King on the Washington Mall, and with similar effect. I saw three thousand people at the World Urban Forum leap up from their chairs and cheer in response. UN statisticians brought their hands together despite themselves. Indian economists beamed and loosened their ties. Senegalese delegates shook and danced in their carnival-colored wraps. Mexican architects whistled. My heart beat faster, too. Pe�alosa seemed to be affirming what so many urban thinkers are sure of, but very rarely have the guts or the audacity to say. The city is a means to a way of life. It can be a reflection of all our best selves. It can be whatever we want it to be. <br>It can change, and change dramatically. <br>The Movement <br>Is urban design really powerful enough to make or break happiness? The question deserves consideration because the happy city message is taking root around the world. Since Pe�alosa&#x2019;s three-year term in office&#x2014;consecutive terms are illegal in Colombia&#x2014;delegations from dozens of cities have landed in Bogot� to study its transformation. Pe�alosa and his younger brother, Guillermo, the city&#x2019;s former parks manager, were called to advise cities on every continent. While the elder proselytized from Shanghai to Jakarta to Lagos, the younger hit Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Toronto. While Guillermo whipped up hundreds of activists in Portland, Enrique was urging planners in Los Angeles to let traffic become so unbearable that drivers simply abandoned their cars. In 2006 Enrique Pe�alosa was the talk of Manhattan after he announced to crowds of gridlock-obsessed New Yorkers they should ban vehicles entirely from Broadway. Three years later, the impossible vision began to come to life around Times Square. The happy city had gone global. <br>The Pe�alosa brothers are far from alone in the happy city crusade. The movement has its roots in the antimodernist foment of the 1960s and has gradually drawn architects, neighborhood activists, public health experts, transportation engineers, network theorists, and politicians into a battle for the shape and soul of cities&#x2014;a confrontation that is finally reaching critical mass. They have torn down freeways in Seoul and San Francisco and Milwaukee. They have experimented with the height, shape, and facades of buildings. They have turned the black top of suburban shopping malls into mini-villages. They have reconfigured entire towns to better suit children. They have torn down backyard fences and reclaimed neighborhood intersections. They are reorganizing the systems that hold cities together and rewriting the rules that dictate the shapes and functions of our buildings. Some of these people aren&#x2019;t even aware that they are part of the same movement, but together they are aiming a wrecking ball at many of the places we have spent the last half century building. <br>Pe�alosa insists that the unhappiest cities in the world, the ones perfectly calibrated to turn wealth into hardship, are not the seething metropolises of Africa or South America. &#x201c;The most dynamic economies of the twentieth century produced the most miserable cities of all,&#x201d; Pe�alosa told me over the roar of traffic in Bogot�. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about the U.S., of course&#x2014;Atlanta, Phoenix, Miami, cities tot...</p><h2>Adaptation and Natural Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought</h2><p><p>Biological evolution is a fact--but the many conflicting theories of evolution remain controversial even today. In 1966, simple Darwinism, which holds that evolution functions primarily at the level of the individual organism, was threatened by opposing concepts such as group selection, a popular idea stating that evolution acts to select entire species rather than individuals. George Williams's famous argument in favor of the Darwinists struck a powerful blow to those in opposing camps. His <i>Adaptation and Natural Selection,</i> now a classic of science literature, is a thorough and convincing essay in defense of Darwinism; its suggestions for developing effective principles for dealing with the evolution debate and its relevance to many fields outside biology ensure the timelessness of this critical work.</p></p><p><b>George C.

With a title drawn from the writings of St. Anselm&#x2014;a beautiful summary of the Christian life&#x2014;this book is designed to both inspire and educate.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The message of these writers is certainly not one of ease and comfortableness, but of faith, hope, and love. Only after wrestling with God, like Jacob in the dark, and being like him permanently wounded, can anyone go towards the brother one has hated and say, &#x201c;I see your face as the face of God&#x201d; (Gen. 33:10). They all used their own life experience, starting where they were, to express the impact on them of the Gospel through self-knowledge and God-knowledge, by submission and repentance, coming closer always to the reality of God in Christ. They spoke out of lives lived within and on behalf of a world as torn and agonizing and filled with doubt as our own. There are many written sources to draw upon in understanding the inner life of our predecessors in these islands. They were human beings like ourselves, and in exploring their journeys we can be refreshed and encouraged in our own.&#x201d; &#x2014;from the introduction<b>Benedicta Ward, SLG</b>&nbsp;is a sister of the Community of Sisters of the Love of God and one of the world authorities on English spirituality and desert monasticism.

The unhappily married Lady Constantine breaks all the rules of social decorum when she falls in love with Swithin St. Cleeve, an astronomer who is ten years her junior. Her husband's death leaves the lovers free to marry, but the discovery of a legacy forces them apart. This is Hardy's most complete treatment of the theme of love across the class and age divide and the fullest expression of his fascination with science and astronomy.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Delicate as a child, he was taught at home by his mother before he attended grammar school. At sixteen, Hardy was apprenticed to an architect, and for many years, architecture was his profession; in his spare time, he pursued his first and last literary love, poetry. Finally convinced that he could earn his living as an author, he retired from architecture, married, and devoted himself to writing. An extremely productive novelist, Hardy published an important book every year or two. In 1896, disturbed by the public outcry over the unconventional subjects of his two greatest novels&#x2014;<b>Tess of the D&#x2019;Urbervilles</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Jude the Obscure</b>&#x2014;he announced that he was giving up fiction and afterward produced only poetry. In later years, he received many honors. He was buried in Poet&#x2019;s Corner, in Westminster Abbey. It was as a poet that he wished to be remembered, but today critics regard his novels as his most memorable contribution to English literature for their psychological insight, decisive delineation of character, and profound presentation of tragedy.<br><br><b>Patricia Ingham</b> is a Senior Research Fellow and Reader at St Anne's College, Oxford. She has written on the Victorian novel and on Hardy in particular. she is the General Editor of all of Hardy's fiction in the Penguin Classics and has edited Gaskell's <i>North and South</i> for the series.Although Two on a Tower is a minor Thomas Hardy work, minor Thomas Hardy is much worth a listener's time. In this novel, set in Wessex, the rich Lady Constantine lives a boring existence, also a chaste one, forced on her by an absent husband who may indeed be dead. But then she meets young Swithin, a naively ambitious astronomer, who shares with her his passion for the stars. Soon the two are passionate about each other, and the malevolent fate so often found in Hardy's novels begins to demand its seemingly inevitable retribution. A sad story, this, read perfectly by Michael Kitchen. He handles the major characters and the minor ones with careful distinction and sensi-tivity to their education and station, and is clearly sympathetic as Lady Constantine's few moments of happiness give way to tragedy. A first-rate reading of a truly fine novel, even if less well known than other Hardy works.

CHERRYH -- Three wishes -- and the strangest love story ever told.<br>LESTER DEL REY -- The little princess didn't really believe in a fairy godmother.<br>SUSAN DEXTER -- The hermit boy didn't know that his pet fawn was a unicorn.<br>WAYLAND DREW -- Each traveler claimed precedence -- until a stranger joined them.<br>BARBARA HAMBLY -- Three strange children from a dragon's lair were loved, until . . .<br>KATHERINE KURTZ -- A fairy learns of faith and love from a holy man.<br>ANNE McCAFFREY -- Humans and the descendants of Pegasus seek to escape their prison.<br>LAWRENCE WATT-EVANS -- Killing a dragon is easy -- once one knows how.</p><p>The brief introduction to this anthology of stories styled as ``modern fairy tales'' reveals its chief weakness--the editors don't convey a good understanding of the fairy tales, and few of their authors have captured the flavor, style, or tone of their putative paradigms. The old tales gathered by the Grimms rarely featured dragons (as in Barbara Hambly's ``Changeling''), nor do the fairies of the ancient legends ever appear as simple bell- tinklers (as in Katherine Kurtz's ``A Tinkling of Fairybells''). The most successful stories here are more similar to the lays and romances of the Middle Ages than to ``Hansel and Gretel'' or ``Rumpelstiltskin''--C.J. Cherryh's ``Gwydion and the Dragon'' and Lawrence Watt-Evan's ``Portrait of a Hero,'' for example, recall Breton ballads, not Hans Christian Andersen. Only the story-within- the-story in Wayland Drew's ``The Old Soul'' manages to re-create the effects of the old fairy tales. The less successful stories here are little more than fluff. Though they don't live up to their billing, the best of these tales are good examples of a very rare breed in today's high fantasy genre--the short story. Almost all such work these days appears in three-or-more book series. Stories such as Cherryh's, Hambly's, and Anne McCaffery's (``The Quest of a Sensible Man'') prove that entertaining high fantasy can be delivered at shorter lengths. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This collection of 10 well written stories nicely illustrates the concept that fairy tale themes are universal, and that modern fantasy writers can give them a sophisticated, psychological and realistic approach while still providing a sense of wonder for all ages. In Barbara Hambly's Changeling, a hard-working Marchlord slays the dragon devastating his countryside and brings home to his wife and children what he finds in its lair: a mute child with two unusual companions. Anne McCaffrey's "The Quest of a Sensible Man" features a prince who seeks a suitable mate for his flying horse. The eponymous "Thistledown" in Susan Dexter's tale is a unicorn colt saved from from predatory hounds by a mute boy suspected of witchcraft. The spoiled princess in "The Fairy Godmother," by Lester del Rey, learns the rudiments of wise rule when she is taken in by an old couple after an attempted abduction. In Wayland Drew's "The Old Soul," an old woman's tale of the fall of a powerful city jolts three travelers out of their self-important lives .

LORENZO DOW Some one has said that all Spirit-filled Christians appear peculiar or eccentric to the people of the world, because &#34;the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God &#34; (1 Cor. 2:14). This was especially true of Lorenzo Dow, the quaint but famous pioneer Methodist preacher, who, about the beginning of the nineteenth century, traveled about the world on foot and on horseback, preaching the Gospel to tens of thousands, and winning multitudes to Christ. In his character Lorenzo Dow very much resembled John Bunyan, but he seems to have had a quiet vein of humor which was lacking in the latter. Like Bunyan he went astray with wicked boys in his youth, and learned many of their ways. Like Bunyan he was haunted by terrible dreams and visions. And like Bunyan he was plunged into awful agony and despair by imagining that God had reprobated, or predestined, him to be damned. Lorenzo Dow was born in Connecticut, October 16, 1777. His parents were born in the same town, but were descended from English ancestors. They had a son and four daughters beside Lorenzo, who was next to the youngest. They tried to educate the children well both in religion and common learning. Lorenzo came near dying when two years of age, and he always suffered from a weak constitution. When he was between three and four years of age, he was one day playing with a companion when he fell into so deep a muse concerning God and heaven that he forgot about his play. He asked his companion if he ever said his prayers, morning or night; and when his friend replied &#34; no,&#34; Lorenzo said, &#34; Then you are wicked and I will not play with you,&#34; and he went into the house. When Lorenzo was eight years of age, his parents removed to another vicinity, the youth of which were very vile, wicked and corrupt. He soo...</p><p>This volume of personal recollections tells of the most meaningful spiritual events in the lives of great Christian leaders throughout history.They Found the Secret<br> <br> A life of grater power can be yours!

Every time I called I could hear her evil whispers poisoning Bill&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Again?&#x201d; that woman, Caroline, would ask. Then the sliding door would whoosh open, slam shut&#x2014;a retreat to the deck&#x2014;and Bill would say, &#x201c;Just take it easy&#x201d; or &#x201c;You get to a meeting today?&#x201d; Bill out there in the snow, looking in at the females, hand raised in a situation-under-control-type gesture.<br><br>It was going on a month that Lilly had been staying with her parents, at their lake house in Vermont. She&#x2019;d left after the window broke&#x2014;after I punched the window. It had been a bad scene: ambulances and police, concerned neighbors milling in their robes. I let her go. I knew that Caroline&#x2014;who I&#x2019;m sure to this day is convinced that I laid hands on Lilly&#x2014;would do her worst to turn her. But I had faith in the colonel. Bill was a peacetime soldier&#x2014;his twenty had fallen smack-dab in the sweet spot between Vietnam and Desert Storm&#x2014;and in his mind, somehow, that was a debt he&#x2019;d never quite repay.<br><br>There was no cell service at the lake house; every time I called the landline, Bill picked up, said Lilly wasn&#x2019;t ready to talk. Finally, I told him I&#x2019;d quit drinking and joined a support group with the VA.<br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re not drunk right now?&#x201d; Bill said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired. The group meets early.&#x201d;<br><br>Bill promised to relay the news. When I called the next day, he told me, &#x201c;Lilly&#x2019;s delighted you&#x2019;re doing that for yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing it for her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still, you can tell her to come home now. It&#x2019;s safe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Lilly&#x2019;s decision, son.&#x201d;<br><br>I allowed myself a swallow from my favorite coffee mug. It was my favorite because it angled out to a wide base that made it difficult to knock over, because there was often vodka in it instead of coffee, and because the wide base meant that the more you drank, the harder it became to reach the bottom.<br><br>&#x201c;Some colonel,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>A few days later, Bill said, &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m gonna have to put an end to this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;End to what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;These talks. You calling here every night.&#x201d; There was a pause, and then Bill added, &#x201c;Your belligerence. Your obsession.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let me talk to Lilly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s afraid of you, son.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because of the window incident?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because of the window incident?&#x201d; &#x201c;The window incident? The window incident? What she says, the window incident was the least of it. Did you tell her she made you want to kill things? &#x2018;Someday, Lilly, you&#x2019;re gonna make me kill something.&#x2019; You never said that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There was a context.&#x201d;<br>Bill sighed. &#x201c;Stick with those meetings.&#x201d;<br><br>I called again&#x2014;every few minutes, then every minute&#x2014;but he wouldn&#x2019;t answer. In the end, Bill was the same as Lilly, same as everyone. People who did not respect the covenant of human relationships. People who believed you could just hang up, walk out. When the Stolichnaya ran dry, I fetched my Bushmaster&nbsp;and a box of ammo, stowed them behind the bench seat of my truck, and headed north.<br><br>It was blizzarding. Not far over the Vermont line the big flakes rushed the beams like I was at warp speed and they were star tracers in a wormhole through the galaxies. At the top of a high pass I spotted a pair of hazards blinking on the shoulder. They belonged to one of those vehicles between a station wagon and a minivan. Two sets of expensive-looking skis were clamped into the racks; the dome light haloed a man and a woman. I watched them watch me stagger through the snow. The woman said something to the man, and the man, still watching me, said something back. At first I didn&#x2019;t understand. Then I glimpsed my reflection in the paint of that car&#x2014;the neck tattoo and face scar, that problem with my eyes. I motioned for the man to roll down his window.<br>&#x201c;You OK, buddy?&#x201d; he said. <br><br>He wore a turtleneck sweater and snow pants, and the woman, she had on something zippered and moisture-wicking. The man had only rolled down the window an inch or two; all the doors were locked&#x2014;I caught the woman checking. She squeezed her hands tight between her thighs. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m OK,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Are you OK?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Us?&#x201d; said the man. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re OK, yeah.&#x201d; <br>He seemed to think it was my turn to talk. Eventually, he told me, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just waiting on the plows.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where you headed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nowhere,&#x201d; said the woman. <br>The man laughed. &#x201c;Road&#x2019;s too slick to get down, is what she means.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Think so?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t try it.&#x201d; <br><br>I regarded the far end of the pass, where the road that had brought us all up the mountain dropped down its back side. &#x201c;Is that just you, though?&#x201d; <br>The man frowned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s treacherous. Every year, some joker&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nathan,&#x201d; the woman said. <br>The man turned to her, turned back to me. <br>&#x201c;But hey,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you be my guest.&#x201d;<br><br>Once, during an ambush in Kunar, I saw a private stooping to pick spent casings out of the dirt and put them in his pocket&#x2014;proof positive of the old maxim &#x201c;You fight how you train.&#x201d; Muscle memory, however, has its limits, and some knowledge defies inculcation. For instance, another maxim: &#x201c;Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.&#x201d; That is as true, when you are all keyed up, as it is unlikely to be remembered.<br><br>I was halfway to the valley floor when my truck went sailing like a ship without a keel. The last thing I recall is a wall of white ice that looked like molten crystal&#x2014;that euphoric breath before the boom, when your asshole puckers and you wait.<br><br>I woke to a teenager Velcroing a device around my neck. He was concentrating with his entire face. His mouth was closed; a rim of tongue protruded like a middle lip.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s conscious!&#x201d; screamed the boy.<br><br>I pushed him off and climbed out of the cab. Up on the road, silhouettes stood among a fleet of four-wheel-drive SUVs, tall radio antennas and colored lights atop their roofs. The teenager was sprawled in the snow. &#x201c;Just take it easy,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;I need a tow truck.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the silhouettes stepped forward. He wore a winter hat&nbsp;with the earflaps down, a heavy coat with a star-shaped badge. A deputy badge. <br><br>&#x201c;Only place that truck&#x2019;s getting towed to is the wrecking yard,&#x201d; he said. <br>I looked. The front end was crumpled against the escarpment and the windshield sagged on the dash like a limp sheet of Saran Wrap. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky someone happened by,&#x201d; said the deputy. He was taking stock&#x2014;neck tattoo, face scar, eyes&#x2014;and not feeling reassured. <br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Called it in? Couple on a ski trip.&#x201d; The deputy squinted at me, like I was small or far away. &#x201c;Said they saw you on the pass.&#x201d; <br><br>The teenager was proffering the neck brace&#x2014;real cautious, at a creep, like he was fixing to snare a rabid dog. <br>&#x201c;Is that really necessary, Mitch?&#x201d; asked the deputy. <br>The question seemed to wound the boy. &#x201c;Depends,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you mean is it mandated by the parameters and protocols of the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians, then yes&#x2014;yes, Dep, it&#x2019;s really necessary.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just give us a minute, huh?&#x201d; <br>After Mitch had sort of oozed away, the deputy explained, &#x201c;First responders.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;You mind?&#x201d; Without waiting for an answer, he unholstered a Maglite and aimed it in my truck. &#x201c;Gotta ask,&#x201d; he said, craning to see, working the beam. &#x201c;What were you doing out here, conditions so bad?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Lake Champlain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Got people up there?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>What they say about the way a man stabs versus the way&nbsp;a woman stabs&#x2014;how he holds the knife high, like a spyglass, whereas she holds it low, like a spatula? Same goes for flashlights, I would argue. There are aberrations, of course, and the deputy was one. He held his like a woman. <br><br>&#x201c;Dep?&#x201d; came a plaintive voice from the road&#x2014;Mitch. &#x201c;Can I at least assess the patient? At least got to assess, that&#x2019;s bare minimum.&#x201d; <br><br>I trudged over to the SUVs and sat on a tailgate. Mitch produced a stethoscope and requested that I lift my shirt. <br><br>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; another responder, a Mitch-like slob with a chin beard, commented. <br><br>Except for the one on my neck, it was all heavy, martial imagery. Intense, I&#x2019;d been told. <br>Also: gross. <br><br>Mitch was pressing the cold diaphragm against my back&#x2014;reading the names, probably, on the tombstones there&#x2014;when the deputy let out a whistle. He&#x2019;d opened the door of my truck and was halfway in the cab, foot in the air. When he emerged he had the AR in his hand. <br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; Chin Beard said. <br>&#x201c;That a Bushmaster?&#x201d; asked Mitch. <br>&#x201c;You betcha.&#x201d; The deputy raised it to a firing position, nestling the butt stock in his shoulder. &#x201c;Seen one like it at the Brattleboro show.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Brent has one,&#x201d; Chin Beard said. <br>&#x201c;Like hell he does,&#x201d; said Mitch. <br>&#x201c;He has one, Mitch.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Brent?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fellas,&#x201d; the deputy said. <br><br>He brought the weapon to one of the SUVs and laid it across the seat like it was a napping babe. &#x201c;Relax, son,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in Vermont.&#x201d; <br><br>Later, though, after Mitch had completed his assessment and I&#x2019;d signed a paper refusing medical assistance and we were all preparing to continue down the mountain, the deputy, as if he&#x2019;d just remembered and was embarrassed to have to bring it up, said, &#x201c;Oh, yeah. One thing. Those folks who called it in&#x2014;the skiers? They mentioned that when they saw you on the pass . . . well, they seemed to think you might&#x2019;ve had a few. Anything to that?&#x201d;</p><h2>Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to A More Meaningful Life</h2><p>How should we live? According to philosopher and biologist Massimo Pigliucci, the greatest guidance to this essential question lies in combining the wisdom of 24 centuries of philosophy with the latest research from 21st century science.&nbsp;In <i>Answers for Aristotle</i>, Pigliucci argues that the combination of science and philosophy first pioneered by Aristotle offers us the best possible tool for understanding the world and ourselves. As Aristotle knew, each mode of thought has the power to clarify the other: science provides facts, and philosophy helps us reflect on the values with which to assess them. But over the centuries, the two have become uncoupled, leaving us with questions&#x2014;about morality, love, friendship, justice, and politics&#x2014;that neither field could fully answer on its own. Pigliucci argues that only by rejoining each other can modern science and philosophy reach their full potential, while we harness them to help us reach ours.&nbsp;Pigliucci discusses such essential issues as how to tell right from wrong, the nature of love and friendship, and whether we can really ever know ourselves&#x2014;all in service of helping us find our path to the best possible life. Combining the two most powerful intellectual traditions in history, <i>Answers for Aristotle</i> is a remarkable guide to discovering what really matters and why.<br></p><p><b>Massimo Pigliucci</b> is a professor in the philosophy program at the City University of New York&#x2019;s Graduate Center and was formerly a biology professor at Stony Brook University.

Longtime parishioner Mitchell Striker, a retired financial advisor, is to give a lecture on investing at the church's social center. His body, however, is found in his car in the parking lot; he's been killed, it turns out, by an injection of Demerol. The police arrest Jerome Winegar, who, 20 years before, was a star pupil at St. Peter's School for Orphans. Striker was a board member there, and instrumental in getting Winegar expelled when Striker's daughter Nancy became pregnant as a result of her love affair with the young man. Now, after a stint in the army and aimless jobs in other places, a suave Winegar is back in Fox River--to get his revenge on Striker, according to the prosecution. Moving in with much younger reporter Lucy Sommers, even as he escorted a wealthy widow around town, hasn't much enhanced the picture of Winegar's character. Meanwhile, Nancy Striker, married to dentist Jim Walsh and the mother of two sons, has a problem brought on by her father's death- -what to tell her adopted sister Kate, now an heiress and determined to find her birth parents? It takes another killing to get Winegar off the hook and to precipitate the Grand Guignol finish, with loose ends flapping all the way. A should-be compelling story dissipated in self-indulgent philosophizing, sloppy plotlines, and an over-the-top climax. Long- term fans won't complain. Others may wish for the might have been. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In all likelihood, our problems stem from our adherence to a secularized perspective that views work as the means to material gain, with leisure a badly needed respite from work&#39;s drudgery. Leland Ryken examines this secular view and points to the liberating perspective of the Scriptures: both our work and our leisure have as their overarching aim to glorify God.

He reveals the astonishing new culture wars playing out in our workplaces, universities, schools and homes in the names of social justice, identity politics and `intersectionality&#39;. We are living through a postmodern era in which the grand narratives of religion and political ideology have collapsed. In their place have emerged a crusading desire to right perceived wrongs and a weaponization of identity, both accelerated by the new forms of social and news media. Narrow sets of interests now dominate the agenda as society becomes more and more tribal - and, as Murray shows, the casualties are mounting. Readers of all political persuasions cannot afford to ignore Murray&#39;s masterfully argued and fiercely provocative book, in which he seeks to inject some sense into the discussion around this generation&#39;s most complicated issues.

But over the next 150 years it grew to become the greatest and most diverse empire the world has ever seen&#x2014;ranging from Canada to Australia to China, India, and Egypt&#x2014;seven times larger than the Roman Empire at its apogee. Britannia ruled the waves and a quarter of the earth.<br><br>Yet it was also a fundamentally weak empire, as Piers Brendon shows in this vivid and sweeping chronicle. Run from a tiny island base, the British Empire operated on a shoestring with the help of local elites. It enshrined a belief in freedom that would fatally undermine its authority. Spread too thin, and facing wars, economic crises, and domestic discord, the empire would vanish almost as quickly as it appeared.<br><br>Within a generation, the mighty structure collapsed, sometimes amid bloodshed. This rapid demise left unfinished business in Rhodesia, the Falklands, and Hong Kong. It left an array of dependencies and a ghost of an empire overshadowed by a rising America. Above all, it left a contested legacy: at best, a sporting spirit, a legal code, and a near-universal language; at worst, failed states and internecine strife.<br><br>Brendon tells this story with brio and brilliance; covering a vast canvas, he fills it with vivid firsthand accounts of life in the colonies and intimate portraits of the sometimes eccentric British officials who administered them. It is all here&#x2014;from brief lives to telling anecdotes to comic episodes to symbolic moments.

He lives in Cambridge, England.The World Turned Upside Down<br><br>The American Revolution and the Slave Trade<br><br>At about ten o&#x2019;clock in the bright morning of 17 October 1781, a lone drummer boy dressed in shabby bearskin and red coat scrambled on to the ruined earthworks outside Yorktown and beat for a parley. From their trenches, which encircled the little tobacco port like a noose, George Washington&#x2019;s forces could see him through the smoke of battle. But they could not hear him because of the thunder of their hundred guns. Firing incessantly were 24-pound siege pieces which smashed the fortifications, 8-inch howitzers which dismembered their defenders, lighter cannon whose balls splintered the clapboard houses along the bluff overlooking Chesapeake Bay and sometimes skipped over the water like flat stones, and heavy French mortars whose 200-pound projectiles&#x2014;black bombshells clearly visible in daylight, blazing meteors after dark&#x2014;made the whole peninsula shake. Then, behind the boy, a British officer appeared, waving a white handkerchief. He bore a message from Lord Cornwallis, whose battered army had no means of escape, proposing to end the bloodshed. The barrage ceased, the emissary was blindfolded and the terms of the British surrender were negotiated. Washington, unbending in his role as the noblest republican of them all, administered a severe blow to imperial pride. Cornwallis&#x2019;s 7,200 troops were to become prisoners of war. They were to march, flags furled, between the ranks of their foes drawn up along the road from Yorktown, which passed through fields white with ripe cotton bolls, and lay down their arms.<br><br>It was a &#x201c;humiliating scene,&#x201d; watched in dead silence by the Americans, clad in ragged homespun, some &#x201c;almost barefoot,&#x201d; and their French allies, plumed and often mustachioed, immaculate in white uniforms and black gaiters, their pastel silk banners decorated with silver fleurs-de-lis. King George III&#x2019;s German mercenaries marched past steadily but the British &#x201c;lobsters&#x201d; (as the Americans called them) were less dignified. Some were the worse for rum&#x2014;the largest single item of expenditure borne by the British Army during the war. Others were disdainful, others defiant. A few flung down their heavy, smooth-bored Brown Bess muskets as though to smash them. Lieutenant-Colonel Abercromby, who had led the only serious sortie from Yorktown, chewed his sword in impotent rage. According to an American witness, the British officers behaved like whipped schoolboys. &#x201c;Some bit their lips, some pouted, others cried,&#x201d; hiding such emotions beneath their round, broad-brimmed hats. Cornwallis himself remained in Yorktown, pleading indisposition but perhaps unable to face the triumph of revolution. Meanwhile, the bandsmen of his captive army played a &#x201c;melancholy&#x201d; tune on drums and fifes. It was the dirge of the British Empire in America, &#x201c;The World Turned Upside Down.&#x201d;<br><br>The Old World did regard the New World&#x2019;s victory as an ominous inversion of the established order. It was an unbeaten revolt of children against parental authority&#x2014;the first successful rebellion of colonial subjects against sovereign power in modern history. How could a rabble of farmers in thirteen poor appendages, with a population of only 2.5 million, defeat the trained might of the mother country? Americans were divided among themselves and thinly spread along an underdeveloped eastern seaboard which shaded gradually into isolated pioneer settlements and virgin wilderness. They were opposed not only by white loyalists but by black slaves and &#x201c;Red Indians.&#x201d; Washington&#x2019;s recruits, in a spirit of democratic &#x201c;licentiousness&#x201d; (his word), were disinclined to take orders without discussion: as one senior officer complained, &#x201c;The privates are all generals.&#x201d; Their auxiliaries, until the advent of the French, were wholly undisciplined. The militia consisted of summer foot soldiers on furlough from the plough and, wrote one witness, a cavalry of round-wigged tailors and apothecaries mounted on &#x201c;bad nags&#x201d; who looked &#x201c;like a flock of ducks in cross-belts.&#x201d; These were supported at times by tattooed and buckskinned frontiersmen with tomahawks in their belts, bear grease in their hair and coonskin hats on their heads.<br><br>Yet this motley array often proved effective, particularly in guerrilla fighting. After the &#x201c;shot heard round the world&#x201d; which had opened hostilities at Lexington in 1775, the redcoats made such a &#x201c;vigorous retreat,&#x201d; quipped Benjamin Franklin, that the &#x201c;feeble Americans could scarce keep up with them.&#x201d;On other occasions British generals proved dauntlessly incompetent. &#x201c;Gentleman Johnny&#x201d; Burgoyne distinguished himself less as a professional soldier than an amateur dramatist&#x2014;when his play <i>The Bloodbath of Boston</i> was performed the audience at first thought that American shelling was part of the show&#x2014;and in 1777 his histrionic recklessness led to the British capitulation at Saratoga. By contrast, George Washington, though by no means a military genius, was a great leader. Tall and stately in his familiar buff and blue uniform, with a long pallid face dominated by a jutting nose, a broad mouth and steely grey-blue eyes, he looked the part. And he played it with courage and canniness. Formidably self-possessed, ruthlessly single-minded, incomparably tenacious, he made small gains and avoided large losses, staving off defeat until he could achieve victory.<br><br>Before Yorktown, after six years of war, that outcome still appeared remote, despite the support of Spain and Holland as well as France, which the Earl of Chatham described as a &#x201c;vulture hovering over the British Empire.&#x201d; Redcoat bayonets dominated the battlefield and Britannia still ruled the waves. General Clinton had an iron grip on New York. From there he wrote to Cornwallis in March 1781:<br>Discontent runs high in Connecticut. In short, my Lord, there seems little wanting to give a mortal stab to Rebellion but a proper Reinforcement, and a permanent superiority at Sea for the next Campaign without which any Enterprize depending on Water Movements must certainly run great Risk.<br>Cornwallis himself was subjugating the south. He was assisted by Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who boasted of having &#x201c;butchered more men and lain with more women than anybody&#x201d;&#x2014;he should have said <i>ravished</i>, remarked the playwright Sheridan, since &#x201c;rapes are the relaxation of murder.&#x201d; Washington&#x2019;s forces had scarcely recovered from their winter agonies at Valley Forge and Morristown, where, as one soldier wrote, &#x201c;It has been amazing cold to such a Degree that I who never flinched to old Boreas had t&#x2019;other day one of my Ears froze as hard as a Pine gnut.&#x201d; In the spring of 1781 Washington wrote,<br>our Troops are approaching fast to nakedness and . . . we have nothing to cloath them with . . . our hospitals are without medicines, and our Sick without Nutriment . . . all our public works are at a stand . . . we are at the end of our tether . . . now or never our deliverance must come.<br>It came with French men-of-war.<br><br>In August, Washington heard that Admiral de Grasse was sailing with a fleet of twenty-eight ships of the line and bringing three thousand more regular soldiers to reinforce the five thousand commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau. Washington seized his opportunity. In great secrecy he disengaged from Clinton and marched his army south through New Jersey. When he heard that de Grasse had reached Chesapeake Bay, cutting Cornwallis off from outside help, Washington abandoned his usual reserve. He capered about on the quay at Chester, waving his hat and his handkerchief, and embraced Rochambeau as he arrived. The young Marquis de Lafayette was even more effusive when he met Washington at Williamsburg. He leapt off his horse, &#x201c;caught the General round his body, hugged him as close as it was possible and absolutely kissed him from ear to ear.&#x201d; The news was a tonic to the whole army&#x2014;it even cured General Steuben&#x2019;s gout. For everyone except the British believed that Cornwallis would be &#x201c;completely Burgoyned.&#x201d; &#x201c;We have got him handsomely in a pudding bag,&#x201d; wrote General Weedon. &#x201c;I am all on fire. By the Great God of War, I think we may all hand up our swords by the last of the year in perfect peace and security!&#x201d;<br><br>Washington personally ensured that his &#x201c;mouse-trap&#x201d; snapped shut. He made meticulous preparations, even going so far as to pay his troops (with French gold). He surveyed Yorktown&#x2019;s defences from an exposed position where &#x201c;shot seemed flying almost as thick as hail.&#x201d; With a pickaxe he broke the ground for the opening trench and he put a match to the first gun in the cannonade. Washington pressed forward fast, puzzled by the sluggishness of the enemy. Although erratic, Cornwallis was an able commander. He was brave, tactically adept and adored by his men, whose hardships he shared. But apart from shooting starving horses and expelling hungry slaves (many of them ill with malaria, smallpox and dysentery), he took few initiatives at Yorktown.

Estrada used her will to record her debts and credits, specify her property, leave her belongings to her children, make requests for her funeral arrangements, and secure her religious salvation.<br> Wills like Estrada&#x2019;s reveal much about women&#x2019;s lives in the late Spanish and Mexican colonial communities of Santa Fe, El Paso, San Antonio, Saltillo, and San Esteban de Nueva Tlaxcala in present-day northern Mexico. Using last wills and testaments as main sources, Amy M. Porter explores the ways in which these documents reveal details about religion, family, economics, and material culture. In addition, the wills speak loudly to the difficulties of frontier life, in which widowhood and child mortality were commonplace. Most importantly,<br>information in the wills helps to explain the workings of the patriarchal system of Spanish and Mexican borderland communities, showing that gender role divisions were fluid in some respects. Supplemented by censuses, inventories, court cases, and travelers&#x2019; accounts, women&#x2019;s wills paint a more complete picture of life in the borderlands than the previously male-dominated historiography of the region.</p><p>Amy M.

He is showing signs of age and he gradually realizes he is losing his powers of prophecy and clairvoyance to a younger generation.

They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day.

For Erotica, we surface from the subterranean realms of the museums to enter those of our national and private libraries. Here we discover that not only most of our famous writers, such as Ovid, Aretino, Voltaire, Verlaine or Maupassant, wrote erotic texts that bordered on indecency, but also that great artists like Boucher, Fragonard, Dal? or Matisse were inspired to provide suitable illustrations for these naughty books.

Her first book, <i>Women with Attention Deficit Disorder</i>, has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide. Now, in <i>Journeys Through ADDulthood</i>, she takes a groundbreaking look at the emotional turmoil often precipitated by ADD and offers readers roadmaps to richer, happier lives.</p><p>Although most commonly associated with children, attention deficit disorder (ADD or AD/HD) affects the lives of between 8 and 10 million American adults. Even years after diagnosis, many adults still feel discouraged because treatments tend to focus exclusively on managing or overcoming the symptoms of ADD rather than on teaching patients to lead a fulfilling life despite these differences. Sari Solden, who struggles with ADD and these issues herself, has spent the past twelve years focusing her work on the emotional challenges men and women face with ADD in their lives. <i>Journeys Through ADDulthood</i> is her profoundly empathetic and inspiring guide to living a rich and full life even as the effects of ADD remain. </p><p>Living with ADD affects the development of one's view of self, especially for those not diagnosed until adulthood, after an entire childhood of feeling "different" without knowing why. There are no quick fixes&#x2015;Solden takes a longer view of the challenges and sees living with ADD as an ongoing internal process. <i>Journeys Through ADDulthood </i>is a step-by-step guide through three stages, or journeys: toward understanding your brain and your primary symptoms; toward discovering your true identity and embracing your uniqueness; and toward learning to share your true self to connect with others. Illuminating her points based on the real-life journeys of two men and two women, Solden offers self-help exercises at the end of each chapter to point the way around common roadblocks on the road to empowerment, self-fulfillment, and the realization of long-buried dreams and goals.</p></p><p><p>A psychotherapist who herself struggles with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD), <b>Sari Solden</b> specializes in individual, couple, and group work with AD/HD adults and their partners. She also trains, and consults with, other mental-health professionals in assessing and counseling adults with AD/HD. <i>Journeys Through ADDulthood</i>, her second book, grew out of twelve years of working with men and women with AD/HD, during which time she developed a framework for understanding the difference between those who <i>get stuck</i> following diagnosis and those able to grow and move on. Her goals are to share her understanding of the developmental milestones in the lives of AD/HD adults, assist those men and women in achieving greater self-awareness and fulfillment, and foster increased understanding among the non-AD/HD population.</p>Solden (Women with Attention Deficit Disorder) follows her earlier work on women with ADD with this expanded focus on the estimated eight to ten million adult Americans who have ADD. Although the condition is most commonly associated with children, Solden reveals that years after diagnosis many adults still feel discouraged because their treatment focused exclusively on managing or overcoming the symptoms of ADD rather than on teaching them how to lead a fulfilling life. Her professional skill in helping others cope with ADD shines through in this well-organized, frankly stated work. The material is organized into three stages: understanding the brain and primary symptoms of ADD, discovering one's true identity and accepting one's uniqueness, and learning to share one's self with others. Examples of real-life journeys of two patients with ADD, and numerous self-help exercises at the end of each chapter, add value to this superior work, which is targeted to lay readers but will also be of use to mental health professionals. The excellent appendix includes practical tools for organizing one's life and a useful guide for professionals working with patients with ADD; the additional resources cover books, URLs, and organizations that focus on ADD. This important work stands out among the growing number of books on ADD for its focus on adults and the author's emphasis on learning how to come to terms with and live comfortably with the disease.

His journalism on secret government programs received the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting. As a correspondent for The New York Times, he covered war and terrorism in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sudan, and other nations. He directs the Carey Institute&#39;s nonfiction residency program in upstate New York and teaches as an Anschutz Distinguished Fellow in American Studies at Princeton.In this book based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles for the Philadelphia Inquirer , journalist Weiner probes the way the Pentagon has used secret budgets to fund huge military programs. This has grown to the point that there are now more than 100 multimillion- and multibillion-dollar weapons systems, many of them nuclear weapons designed to fight and win World Wars III and IV, built without the awareness of the public or even the Congress. Weiner takes a close look at programs such as the Stealth bomber and provides fascinating detail from Congressional testimony. The thesis of the book--that secrecy in government military programs is antithetical to democracy--is well documented and hugely important. As the Cold War draws to a close and military budgets come under attack, the public and Congress may tend to forget the defense establishment's inclination toward secrecy and self-perpetuation. Weiner's book serves as a timely reminder that this would be unwise.

Above all, it is the story of beautiful, ruthless Scarlett O'Hara and the dashing soldier of fortune, Rhett Butler.</p><p>Since its first publication in 1936, <i>Gone With The Wind </i>has endured as a story for all our times.This beautiful edition of the classic love story features a special introduction by Philippa Gregory, author of <i>The White Queen </i>and <i>The Other Boleyn Girl.</i></p></p><p>"Fascinating and unforgettable! A remarkable book, a spectacular book, a book that will not be forgotten!" -- "Chicago Tribune"<br><br>"I first read "Gone with the Wind" in grade school--a boy of the upper South who'd seen the great movie and felt compelled to learn what lay behind it, all thousand-plus pages worth. No page disappointed me. What other American novel surpasses its eagerness to tell a great story of love and war; what characters equal the cantankerous passions of Scarlett and Rhett? Even Scott Fitzgerald spoke well of it. What more could I ask, even seven decades later?" -- Reynolds Price<br><br>"GWTW is an indelible portrait of a unique time and place, American's greatest political and moral conflict, and the myths that surround it -- an all absorbing spectacle of a read even for postmodern readers. Mitchell vividly portrays the disillusionment and devastation of war, the ignorance of the uninitiated, and the transformation of arrogance into tenacity that shaped the first "new South." All the details of history and place come together as a rich backdrop for those unforgettable characters: shallow and selfish Scarlett, sincere Melanie, moony-eyed Ashley, and the sage, pragmatic, dashing, and rakish Rhett Butler--the most enduring heartthrob of American literature has produced. I'd reread the book for the thrill of Rhett alone!" -- Darnell Arnoult, author of "Sufficient Grace"<br><br>"In 1936 I was in E.M. Daggett Junior High in Ft. Worth, Texas. By some chance I was able to read "Gone with the Wind" early on. Then and now, I found it one of the great experiences of a young life. I still list it as one of my 10 favorite books." -- Liz Smith, nationally syndicated columnist<br><br>"Beyond a doubt one of the most remarkable first novels produced by an American writer. It is also one of the best." -- "The New York Times"<br><br>"Not just a great love story, "Gone with the Wind" is one of the most powerful anti-war novels ever written. Told from the standpoint of the women left behind, author Margaret Mitchell brilliantly illustrates the heartbreaking and devastating effects of war on the land and its people." -- Fannie Flagg, Academy Award nominated-author<br><br>"The best novel to have ever come out of the South...it is unsurpassed in the whole of American writing." -- "The Washington Post"<br><br>"Let's say you've read "Gone with the Wind" at least twice, and seen the movie over and again. So, here's a thought. Buy this handsome paperback edition, just for Pat Conroy's preface. This passionate, nearly breathless love letter is a Song of Solomon to Margaret Mitchell, Scarlett O'Hara, and Conroy's beautiful, GTW-obsessed mother. Indeed, his luminous preface packs a durable wallop, just like the epic Pulitzer prize-winning work that inspires it." -- Jan Karon, author of "The Mitford Years" series<br><br>"In my own personal life, I find many similarities to Scarlett's: The whole 17-inch waist thing notwithstanding, I do love a barbecue, both for the food and the men--I have been known to "eat like a field hand and gobble like a hawg"--I admit that at least on one occasion I may have feigned interest in some guy to further my own interests--I have fought tooth, toenail and tirelessly for my family--I learn slow but I learn good--and even so, I still adore the prospect of dealing with most things...Tomorrow." -- Jill Conner Browne, The Sweet Potato Queen, bestselling author of "The Sweet Potato Queens' First Big-Ass Novel"<br><br>""Gone with the Wind" is one of those rare books that we never forget. We read it when we're young and fall in love with the characters, then we watch the film and read the book again and watch the film again and never get tired of revisiting an era that is the most important in our history. Rhett and Scarlet and Melanie and Ashley and Big Sam and Mammy and Archie the convict are characters who always remain with us, in the same way that Twain's characters do. No one ever forgets the scene when Scarlet wanders among the wounded in the Atlanta train yard; no one ever forgets the moment Melanie and Scarlet drag the body of the dead Federal soldier down the staircase, a step at a time. "Gone with the Wind" is an epic story.

She knew a way, for example, to make an umbrella shoot a poison dart. Also that the CIA had tried to kill the president of Cuba with an exploding clam. She showed me how to send secret messages by underlining words in a newspaper and dropping it on a bench."</i><p> To 8-year-old Grace Davitt, her mother is a puzzling yet wonderful mystery. This is a woman who has seen a sea serpent in the lake, who paints a timeline of the universe (in which "one billion years of real time = 24 days on the cosmic calendar") on the sewing-room wall, and who teaches her daughter a secret language which only they can speak. To the reader, however, it soon becomes clear that Anna Davitt is more than just eccentric. As her obsessions grow, her relationship with Grace's father, Robert, gradually deteriorates until at last the family breaks apart and Grace is left alone with her unstable mother. </p><p> Writing an adult novel from a young child's point of view is a tricky business, but Jenny Offill pulls it off without breaking a sweat. God is in the details here, and these are spot-on, from young Grace's fascination with the blind girl who lives in the neighborhood to her speculations about the prior tenant of the uninhabited dog house in the backyard. Grace inhabits that peculiar geography of childhood where all things are reasonable, from the descriptions of gazelle-boys in her <i>Encyclopedia of the Unexplained</i> to her mother's mercurial mood shifts. What makes Anna Davitt's spiral into madness so unnerving is the fact that to her daughter this is business as usual. <i>Last Things</i> has been compared to that other classic of unconventional childhood, <i> Housekeeping</i>; certainly Offill's debut is richly deserving of the company it keeps. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Grace's father believes in science and builds his daughter a dollhouse with lights that really work. Grace's mother takes her skinny-dipping in the lake and teaches her about African hyena men who devour their wives in their sleep. Grace's world, of fact and fiction, marvels and madness, is slowly unraveling because her family is coming apart before her eyes. Now eight-year-old Grace must choose between her two very different, very flawed parents, a choice that will take her on a dizzying journey, away from her home in Vermont to the boozy, flooded streets of New Orleans--and into the equally wondrous and frightening realm of her own imagination.<br>With eloquence and compassion, Jenny Offill weaves a luminous story of a wounded family and of a young girl yearning to understand the difference between fiction, fact, and hope. A novel of vibrant imagination and searing intelligence, Last Things is a stunning literary achievement.</p><h2>Disney&#39;s Elegant Book of Manners</h2><p>A large, beautifully illustrated book about manners for children. The book has the favorite characters, such as Snow White, Mickey Mouse, Donald and Daisy Duck, Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, Winnie the Pooh, and many more to illustrate proper manners. Fun and educational!</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3 When Mama Bear's efforts to improve her family's manners through coaxing, complaining and shouting are unsuccessful, she devises a Politeness Plana chart listing a chore as penalty for each act of rudeness. The cubs plot to be so polite that Mama won't be able to stand it but find that it is impossible to be too polite. Basic etiquette including saying "please" and "thank you," and not interrupting are presented in a practical way. The familiar Berenstain illustrations add humor and understanding. Jefferds' rambling discourse in verse offers a wide variety of admonitions on what children should do. General aspects of etiquette are covered in a haphazard way, sometimes mentioned in one place and then again later. Topics of concern, but not necessarily related to manners, such as the problems of pollution, of avoiding strangers and care of one's own things, are interspersed throughout. A portion about Jack Spratt and his wife which concludes that "It's not too smart to get too fat," and a fable about proper table settings seem superfluous. Illustrations featuring traditional Disney characters are apparently intended to reinforce the concepts through humor, but the gross exaggerations often verge on the ridiculous and detract from the message. Better presentations can be found in the Berenstains' book and in Brown and Krensky's Perfect Pigs: an Introduction to Manners (Atlantic , 1983). Phyllis K.

When Baptist missionary Kevin Greeson found himself in the midst of one of the largest Church Planting Movements the Muslim world has ever seen, he went to these new Muslim&#x2013;background believers and asked them, "How are you winning your family and friends to faith in Jesus Christ?" Their reply was, "Come, walk with us."In the months that followed Kevin learned how Muslim&#x2013;background Christ followers were reaching their lost Muslim friends, and bringing them to the good news of Jesus Christ. He learned the secrets of the Camel, how to bridge Muslims from the Qur'an and into the New Testament where they could encounter Jesus Christ for themselves.The CAMEL is an acronym used to highlight four bridges to the gospel that appear in the Qur'an's surah al&#x2013;Imran 3:42&#x2013;55. The "C" recalls the fact that Maryam (Mary) was Chosen to give birth to the Messiah. The "A" reminds us that Angels Announced that even though she was a virgin, God would cause the Messiah to be born through her. The "M" points to the Miracles Jesus would do. And the "EL" refers to Jesus' Eternal Life. Kevin Greeson's The Camel tells the inside story of one of the world's fastest growing Muslim movements to Christ that produced more than 100,000 baptisms.

A handful of islanders gather in the small aft cabin, warming themselves by the tiny black stove, while their groceries and shopping bags chill on the deck alongside rows of propane tanks and other large island-bound parcels. Mailbags rest in the starboard cubbyhole, protected from the elements, which can be extremely assertive during the fourteen-mile crossing from the mainland. From November to April, the Laura B. is the only link to the mainland for Monhegan's sixty year-round residents, making the round-trip journey from the tiny fishing town of Port Clyde only three times a week.<p>But on this last day of November, the Laura B. is packed with people. There are nearly as many people on board as live on the island this time of year, most of them mainlanders on their way out to help friends and family prepare for the most important day of Monhegan's year. Tomorrow, December 1, is Trap Day, the day Monhegan's lobstermen begin their unique, winter- only lobster season.</p><p>At a time of year when most of Maine's seven thousand lobster- men have hauled up their traps and brought their boats around to secure winter anchorages, Monhegan's fourteen lobstermen are getting ready to set their traps for the first time since spring. Once the fishermen have set their traps, they'll continue fishing through the dead of winter, braving ferocious weather and subzero temperatures that often leave their twenty-eight- to forty- foot boats encased in frozen spray. The lobstermen can handle this with the help of a sternman or two, but on Trap Day they need all the help they can get moving their heavy traps down to the town wharf. There are only twenty aging, beat-up pickups on the island, but each lobsterman needs to get a gang of six hundred traps, weighted metal cages weighing forty to fifty pounds apiece, out of their backyard, down the hill, and stacked up on the town wharf where they can be loaded onto the lobster boat. It can't be done much beforehand because the island's 8,400 traps can't fit on the granite wharf. Even if they did fit, they'd make offloading the Laura B. next to impossible. So, just before Trap Day, the entire village and dozens of mainlanders turn out to move the traps in the maritime equivalent of a barn-raising ceremony.</p><p>I'm on my way out to help Zoe Zanidakis, the island's only female lobster boat captain and onetime proprietor of the Monhegan House, one of the island's three summer inns. But there's a problem. About two months ago, Zoe quit answering her phone. She stopped picking up her cell phone and left e-mail and answering machine messages unreturned. It was as if Zoe had dropped off the face of the earth. After failing to track her down through several mutual acquaintances&#x2014; nobody seemed to know where she was&#x2014;I decided to board Laura B. as planned and track her down on the island. After all, no Monhegan lobsterman would ever miss Trap Day, least of all a ninth-generation islander like Zoe. Monhegan lobstermen make or break their season in the first few weeks of December, harvesting lobsters in an area that has not been fished in six months. But Trap Day has a ritualistic importance that transcends dollars and cents. &#x201c;It's like cleaning the slate,&#x201d; one islander explained to me. &#x201c;We all come together to get the boats ready and any of the crap and hard feelings that have accumulated in the community are wiped away.&#x201d; As we pass Allen Island and begin the final, seven-mile open ocean crossing, I'm certain Zoe is out there on the gray, humplike shape looming on the horizon.</p><p>It's a mild day for Maine in early winter&#x2014;forty-five degrees and almost sunny, with still air and gently swelling seas&#x2014;so many of the passengers spread out on deck, lounging amid the luggage, propane, and building supplies. I join them, and halfway up the port rail I find Billy Payne, who runs one of the island's two small stores. Billy, tanned from a vacation in South Carolina, tells me Zoe is nowhere to be found. &#x201c;They say she's in a movie out in Hollywood,&#x201d; he says, breaking into an understated smile. &#x201c;But nobody seems to know for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>The Laura B. lolls along, unperturbed by the swells. She's nearly sixty years old, and her wooden hull is only sixty-five feet long, but she was built for tougher chores than the Monhegan mail run: running soldiers and ammunition around Pacific bases during the Second World War. Slowly, steadily, Monhegan grows before us, its features becoming more detailed with each passing minute. First the rocky cliffs emerge from their forested crown. Then the forest reveals its inner anatomy of pine, spruce, and fir trees, straight and tall on the island's interior, stunted or dead along the exposed headlands. Guillemots and other cold-loving seabirds flutter over the primeval scene.</p><p>At first only one or two houses are apparent, poking out from the forest like lost children, along with the lighthouse tower, which sticks up from its hilltop like a ship's funnel. But as we round the island's northern tip and head down the western shore, the village slowly reveals itself. A cluster of wood-shingled houses, fish houses, and boat sheds stand on the gentle hillsides facing the shore. There are two hundred all told, but as we approach the harbor it's clear that most of the buildings are boarded up for the winter.</p><p>We slip past the nasty ledges guarding the north entrance and into the harbor, or what passes for one. Monhegan, a sausage-shaped island two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, doesn't have a single deepwater cove or inlet in which one can protect so much as a skiff. All it has is Manana, a small grass-covered hump of rock that protrudes from the sea alongside Monhegan like a whale calf cuddling next to its mother. Monhegan's lobster boats are moored in the narrow passage between the two islands, an anchorage as uncomfortable as it is beautiful. The four-hundred-yard-wide passage is well protected by the tall islands on either side, and the ledges at the narrow north entrance afford reasonable cover from northeasterly winds. But the harbor is completely open to the south, and in a southwesterly storm the seas race through the harbor unimpeded. During particularly fierce winter storms, waves have crashed through low-lying parts of the village, but the lobster boats themselves ride the tempests out on their heavy moorings. We enter the harbor and come alongside the town's heavy granite wharf. Stacks of lobster traps are already growing at the base of the wharf, and one of the town's aging pickups is driving down the dirt road, piled high with more traps to be unloaded. But as we tie up and begin collecting our bags from their pile on the foredeck, the first thing I notice is the camera crew.</p><p>The three-man crew has set up a tripod-mounted camera and a big pole-mounted mike right on the edge of the wharf to film the mail boat's arrival. The height of the tide is such that the camera is pointed right in our faces, and a couple of people pause to stare at it as we head down the gangway. &#x201c;Just move along,&#x201d; one of the cameramen barks, waving us along with a gloved hand. &#x201c;Pretend we're not here.&#x201d; I try but just up the hill from the wharf I encounter a giant boom crane, poised to capture Trap Day action on the wharf. As I stand, gaping, the pickup pulls alongside me.</p><p>I drop my bags and start stacking lobster traps.</p><p>A burly, red-faced man in a flannel shirt has climbed to the top of the truckload of traps, stacked six-high in the same inverted ziggurat pattern farmers use for hay bales, which makes sense since the traps are approximately the same size and weight as a large hay bale. He passes traps down to the four of us on the ground and we carry them, in turn, to the growing stack on the wharf belonging to that particular fisherman. It's not hard to tell which traps go with which stack. Each lobsterman has already rigged his traps, and every second or third trap has a buoy and a coil of rope inside. The distinctive main buoys are painted in the unique color pattern of their owner, in this case white with an orange top and matching orange and white spindle. Later, when the traps are deployed and the buoys are floating on the surface, there will be no confusion as to whose traps are whose. It quickly becomes evident to me that the traps with the buoys in them are much heavier than the others. These &#x201c;headers&#x201d; are the first to be hauled up in the strings of two or three traps used on the island. Often these are more heavily weighted than the other traps in their string, serving as the anchor for the other traps they are attached to, called &#x201c;tailers.&#x201d;</p><p>The truck is empty, and the four people who came down with it jump in the back and start riding up the hill for another load. We haven't yet spoken a word apart from &#x201c;got it&#x201d; or &#x201c;over there.&#x201d; Another truck rolls in, loaded with traps containing fluorescent pink buoys topped with a black ring. The scene repeats itself. By the time the Laura B.'s crew has finished hoisting the heavy cargo onto the wharf with the boat's gantry crane, truckloads of traps are already waiting to be piled up in her landing zone. After an hour or so, the same trucks begin reappearing with fresh loads of traps. The men and women in the respective crews start acknowledging my existence the second or third time around. We shake our introductions with gloved hands. One couple is from Port Clyde and attended Georges Valley High School at the same time I was at a track and basketball rival a few hours to the northwest. Another guy turns out to be from Boothbay and knows my father. As we stack traps I ask if anyone's seen Zoe. I get all sorts of answers.</p><p>&#x201c;Out to help Zoe? Haven't seen her since October,&#x201d; a taciturn sternman tells me. &#x201c;They say she's doing stunt work out in California.&#x201d; A middle-aged resident assures me she's acting in her own movie and that that's why the film crew is here, sleeping in Zoe's house at the top of the hill. &#x201c;No, no, no,&#x201d; a third islander asserts. &#x201c;She's in Australia with that actor Russell Crowe.&#x201d; After hearing variations of these and other stories throughout the day, I feel like I've stepped into a novel cowritten by the ghosts of Franz Kafka and the Bront� sisters.</p><p>After a teal and white truck comes down to the wharf for the third time, the driver introduces himself. He turns out to be my host, John Murdock, a lobsterman in his mid-forties who also runs one of two year-round bed and breakfasts on the island. &#x201c;Colin!&#x201d; John laughs. &#x201c;Was wondering where you were. Welcome to Monhegan! When we get this unloaded, toss your bags in and we'll show you your room.&#x201d; Fifteen minutes later I'm in the back, bouncing up the hill with a couple of John's friends.</p><p>We pass the imposing Island Inn, its windows boarded up for the winter and a film crew on the lawn, round a corner at the crossroads, and pull up in front of John's rambling house. John's wife, Winnie, shows me to my room, where I dump my bags and change footwear before heading around back to where John's traps have been stacked all summer, waiting for this day. A second stack belongs to his nineteen-year-old son, Ben, who has his own friends out on the island helping. But Ben has been distracted by a problem with his boat's engine, and most of his six hundred traps are still sitting in the backyard. Half of John's stack has already been moved down to the wharf.</p><p>By early evening, the wharf is stacked so high with traps that no more can be safely added. A narrow passage to the wharf's boat ramp passes between the fifteen-foot-high towers of green-, black-, or yellow-coated metal traps. A few boats come alongside and take on twenty or thirty traps for the first run, scheduled for the following morning. After that, the wharf grows quiet as most islanders turn in early in preparation for the manic day ahead.<br><br><i>s</i><br><br>The next morning I awaken to the news that Trap Day, like so many Maine winter events, has been postponed by Mother Nature. It had been blowing at thirty miles an hour from the southwest for much of the night. It was quiet now, but the wind had driven a heavy swell into the unprotected mouth of the harbor that would make loading traps from the wharf more difficult than it was worth. Monhegan's lobstermen, who make all-important decisions collectively down at the Stanley fish house, had decided to hold off for a few hours. They were meeting again at eleven to decide if they would go out in the afternoon.</p><p>It's an unseasonably warm fifty-five degrees, and the road down to the wharf is turning muddy, with pools of water accumulating in the ruts left by the town's little fleet of trucks. All that warm air hanging over the forty-degree water has created another hazard. A pea soup fog is flowing slowly over the village, whose clapboard houses drift in and out of the gray mist. Despite the towering piles of traps, I can't see the wharf until I'm almost standing on it. Inside the traps, the fluorescent paint on the buoys glows as it refracts in the swirling fog. I walk through the narrow canyon between the traps and peer out to sea. I see only two of the fourteen lobster boats in the harbor, their sterns piled high with traps. Manana, just two hundred yards away, is completely invisible, though the foghorn on her far side cries out plaintively from time to time. Big swells crash into the wharf's granite blocks every few seconds, and their splash sizzles on the ocean surface like bacon in a frying pan.</p><p>There's no breakfast place on Monhegan this time of year, but there's fresh coffee down at Billy Payne's store. Billy isn't there when I come in, but he's left a pad of receipts on the counter for patrons to fill out. Some have weighted theirs down with little piles of change and banknotes. Rita White, an elderly lady who once managed not to visit the mainland for seven years, is playing solitaire at one of the store's little booths, and a couple of lobstermen are shooting the shit by the coffee thermoses. Somebody's collie is napping on the floor. I greet people good morning, which seems to take everyone but the dog aback, as if they have gotten out of practice since the summer people went away. Rita sizes me up at a glance. As is often the case in Maine, I'm not sure if I've passed inspection, but she nods assent to my sitting opposite her to drink my coffee.</p><p>The lobstermen are speculating on the result of the upcoming fish house meeting, and there's general agreement that the swells won't die down before nightfall. Problem is, tomorrow is Sunday, and a few of the captains observe the Lord's day of rest. Traditionally, Monheganers don't start their season until everyone is ready. If somebody has engine trouble or a sick relative ashore, fishing is postponed until they can start too. But a number of years back, the fishermen by the coffee thermoses recall, the majority decided to start the season on a Sunday, and some of the older fishermen watched them leave from the beach. &#x201c;Didn't do relations much good on the harbor for a time,&#x201d; one recalls.</p><p>As if on cue, pastor Ted Hoskins comes into the store.

Through its enlarged understanding of the evolution of consciousness and culture, the emerging perspective known as integral consciousness provides realistic and pragmatic solutions to our growing global problems, both environmental and political. As McIntosh convincingly demonstrates, the integral worldview's transformational potential provides a way to literally become the change we want to see in the world. <br>This is really two books in one: the first half serves as an accessible and highly readable introduction to the power of integral consciousness, with the second half making a variety of original contributions to the integral perspective and breaking new ground in the application of integral philosophy to politics and spirituality. Moreover, McIntosh provides a much-needed contextualization and critique of the integral worldview's leading author, Ken Wilber, which helps make integral philosophy relevant to a larger audience.</p></p><p><b>Advance Praise for Integral Consciousness:</b> <p>"This is a very thoughtful, informed and readable book demonstrating wide familiarity with the natural sciences, developmental psychology, political thought, philosophy and spiritual traditions.

Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," whenever a Trustee spoke.<br><br> It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line toward the dining-room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.<br><br> Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.<br><br> The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring "Home" to the driver. But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.<br><br> Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.<br> Je-ru-sha Ab-bott You are wan-ted In the of-fice, And I think you'd Better hurry up!<br> Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of life.<br><br> "Who wants me?" she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.<br> Mrs. Lippett in the office, And I think she's mad. Ah-a-men!<br> Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub his nose off.<br><br> Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. What could have gone wrong, she wondered. Were the sandwiches not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking? Had--O horrors!--one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F "sassed" a Trustee?<br><br> The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. He was waving his arm toward an automobile waiting in the curved drive. As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked, for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.<br><br> Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for visitors.<br><br> "Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you."<br><br> Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.<br><br> "Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?"<br><br> "I saw his back."<br><br> "He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums of money toward the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown."<br><br> Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with the matron.<br><br> "This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his philanthropies have been directed solely toward the boys; I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. He does not, I may tell you, care for girls."<br><br> "No, ma'am," Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.<br><br> "To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought up."</p><h2>Farmer Boy (Little House)</h2><p><p></p><p>The second book in the treasured Little House series, <em>Farmer Boy </em>is Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s beloved story of how her husband, Almanzo, grew up as a farmer boy far from the little house where Laura lived.

He is the author of <i>Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807-1815</i>, published by Yale University Press.Quite a few books deal with the military aspects of the Napoleonic era, especially campaigns, battles, and tactics, but very few focus on the nature of battle or what actually goes on during battle with any serious analysis. Research fellow Muir (Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, Yale Univ., 1996) has filled a significant gap in the study of the period with this engaging study of the mechanics of a Napoleonic battle. Muir uses a tremendous number of firsthand accounts to discuss battlefield events, breaking down each into its component parts. A brief discussion of battles and battlefields is followed by a detailed treatment of each army component: artillery, infantry, and cavalry and the nature of their combat roles as reflected in contemporary accounts. In a separate section, the author considers the role played by the generals and their subordinate commanders, rounding out a well-ordered analysis.

Centennial Award for 100th published novel.<i>My life is a lie.</i><br><br>Savannah Slade stood before a mirror, staring at her own image as if she'd never seen it before. She knew the statistics: twenty-two years old, barely five feet four inches tall, shoulder-length white-blond hair and big blue eyes. She had a baby-doll look, but there was nothing babyish about her.<br><br>Her recently deceased father, Andrew Slade, had raised his daughters to be tough and self-sufficient, and she'd always considered herself that and more. But today she'd learned a devastating secret at the reading of his will. Andrew wasn't her father, and her sisters weren't really her sisters. The journal she was holding held even more secrets&#x2014;secrets that, if revealed, were going to shatter more people's lives than just her own.<br><br>She opened the journal that Coleman Rice, the family lawyer, had given her. Her hands were still shaking. Even though she'd already read the entire book twice over, she returned to the first line. No matter how startling the information, there was no mistaking the truth.<br><br>You are not my child, and my darling Hannah was not your mother. Your real mother's name was Chloe Stewart, and when I first met her in Miami, Florida, she was dying of cancer.<br><br>She backed up to her bed, then sat down with a thump, swallowed past the lump in her throat and continued to read.<br><br>She said she was not married to your father but his name was Gerald Stoss, oldest of twin boys born to Rupert Stoss, and the heir to a massive fortune. She claimed Gerald did not know of your existence until she learned she had inoperable cancer. After that, she contacted him for help. He was devastated to learn your mother was dying, but he assured her he would take care of you. In fact, bring you both into his home and care for her during her last days, and claim you as his rightful heir.<br><br>Savannah shivered. So she was a bastard child. Not unusual. If that had been the only revelation, this would have been a bit easier to accept. But such was not the case.<br><br>She laid the journal aside and walked to the windows overlooking the south side of the ranch, then leaned her forehead against the panes. If only she could close her eyes and wish this horror story away.<br><br>A hard wind suddenly whipped around the corner of the ranch house, reminding her that spring had yet to make a full-fledged appearance in Montana. The weather had been chilly ever since the funeral, and now, three days later, was still the same. The house was warm, the two-story rock-and-cedar structure a strong bulwark against the unforgiving winds that continued to blow. But Savannah garnered no comfort from the familiarity. The family home no longer represented safety to her, and she wondered if she would never know peace again.<br><br>Everything she and her sisters had known from as far back as she could remember was a lie&#x2014;a convoluted fabrication of bits of their pasts that Andrew had woven into their lives with him.<br><br>She felt sick. According to the lawyer, each of them, at different phases of their lives, had been taken in by Andrew, but only after their respective mothers claimed that the girls' lives were in danger. At this point, Savannah was so shocked and angry at the entire revelation that it was difficult to grieve for Andrew's passing. She looked back at the bed and the journal she'd just abandoned. The sight of it taunted her. Unable to leave it alone, she sat down on the mattress, searched for the phrase that had left her speechless and read it again.<br><br>They said they would kill you, just like they'd killed your father.<br><br>Savannah's gut knotted as she scanned through the next two pages of information. What kind of a family had she been born into? If this story was true, she'd just gone from being the baby of the Slade family to the heir to a massive fortune first amassed in the early 1900s by Austrian immigrant Anton Stoss.<br><br>It was a long, convoluted story, but the bottom line was that, although she was illegitimate, inheritance in this case was not based on legal marriage. Instead, the heir of each generation would always be the eldest and firstborn. And even though her father had been a twin, he was the oldest by two minutes, which made him the heir, and since she was <i>his </i>only heir, the vast inheritance was supposedly hers.<br><br>According to the journal, when the family learned that Gerald had fathered a child with a woman who was dying of cancer, and that he intended to bring the woman and toddler into the family and claim the child as his heir, his twin, Joseph, had been furious. According to what Gerald had told Chloe, Joseph resented not being named a dual heir&#x2014;that he'd lost the right by virtue of being born a mere two minutes later.<br><br>Savannah turned the page. Andrew's familiar handwriting jumped out at her.<br><br>Your mother, Chloe, belonged to the church in Miami, Florida, where I'd been asked to hold a revival. She was in the front row every night, her bald head wrapped in a scarf, her skin pale and ashen. You were but a two-year-old toddler, oblivious to the fact that your mother was dying. Your sister, Maria, was already with me and sat nearby on the same pew, so that I might keep a close eye on her. Every night, when your mother would stand and ask for healing, Maria would scoot over and play with you while we prayed for her.<br><br>Then the last night came. She arrived carrying not only you but a stuffed rabbit and a satchel. After the service, she waited until everyone else was gone before telling her story between harsh, choking sobs. My heart ached for her as her story unfolded, and it was then I began to realize that, once again, God had more in mind for me than just preaching His word. According to her, your father, whom she appeared to love deeply, had been killed that very day in a car accident. But it was the phone call she got later that changed her grief to fear. A man told her bluntly that if she tried to make a claim on the Stoss fortune on your behalf, you would meet the same fate your father had met. They said they would kill you, just like they'd killed your father.<br><br>After a long, involved conversation, she convinced me that she had no other options. I looked at you, sleeping peacefully in Maria's lap, and gave in to the inevitable. She gave me a letter entrusting you to my care. A copy of it is in the back of this journal, along with a copy of your birth certificate listing Gerald Stoss as your father. The originals of both documents are with my lawyer, Coleman Rice. Suffice it to say, by the time I left Miami, I had acquired another daughter.<br><br>Savannah closed the journal and set it aside. Before Andrew's abrupt and unexpected death, she'd known her place in the world&#x2014;right here on the Triple S, a huge, sprawling ranch a few miles from Missoula, Montana.<br><br>Although she had not been out of college long, her affinity with numbers had led her to take over the ranch bookkeeping, as well as the breeding registrations for the horse and cattle operations, leaving the role of "woman of the house" to her oldest sister, Holly. Maria, her middle sister, had opted for working with the livestock as well as training the horses.<br><br>Andrew's best friend, thirty-nine-year-old Robert Tate&#x2014;Bud to the family&#x2014;held the job of foreman. And now, after the reading of the will, Bud also held equal ownership in the Triple S.<br><br>This had been her world, but if she was to follow her curiosity and instincts, it was the world she was about to abandon.<br><br>Savannah put on her coat and scarf, and began searching for her car keys. There was one person she had to face with this news before she left for Miami, and he wasn't going to like what she had to say. Telling her childhood sweetheart and almost-fiance, Judd Holyfield, that she was leaving Montana wasn't going to be easy. When she left her room, her purse was on her shoulder and her car keys in her hand.<br><br>"Hey, honey, where are you going?"<br><br>Savannah paused in midstride. Ever since Andrew's death, Bud had taken his duty as foreman beyond the bunkhouse to the big house. She should have known she would never make it out of the house without Bud finding out.<br><br>"I'm going to Judd's."<br><br>Bud eyed the frown lines between Savannah's eyebrows and knew she was dealing with more than grief.<br><br>"Does he know what's happened?"<br><br>"Not yet."<br><br>"What are you going to tell him?"<br><br>Her chin jutted. "That the woman he thinks he loves is a fraud, then see how it goes."<br><br>Bud frowned. "You know him better than that, or at least you should. That's not going to make a damn bit of difference to him."<br><br>"I know, but it still has to be said, and he's not going to like the fact that I'm leaving Montana."<br><br>"So take him with you."<br><br>She shifted angrily. "I may be the smallest Slade on the place, but I don't need a babysitter. Size is a state of mind. I can be as tough and as tall as I need to be."<br><br>Bud loved these women more than he had a right to, hated that the family was coming apart and didn't know how to pull them back into the fold.<br><br>"I know, honey. I didn't mean to imply you were helpless. I worry, okay? But damn it, Savannah, Andrew took you in because you were in danger. Even though you've grown up, there's a strong possibility that the danger still exists&#x2014;maybe more than ever."<br><br>"I know that, but right now, the only danger I'm about to be in is with Judd. Say a prayer for me. I'll see you later."<br><br>Bud flinched at the sound of the closing door, mumbled a quiet prayer for the family, then grabbed his jacket and Stetson and headed for the stables. At least the horses still needed him, which was more than he could say for Andrew's daughters.<br><br>"Hey, boss! Look out!"<br><br>Judd Holyfield reacted to the warning and yanked the reins of his cutting horse just in time to keep from being gored by the horns of an angry mama cow. The rangy brindle was pissed that they'd separated her from her baby and was pitching a royal fit. "Hurry up and get a band on that calf!" Judd yelled, keeping his rope taut and the cow at bay.<br><br>The little bull bawled as the cowboys upended it. While one cowboy held the calf down, another grabbed the bander and deftly slipped a short thick rubber band over the creature's small downy sac before letting him go free. The thick rubber band would slowly stop circulation, which would eventually cause the anatomy in question to shrivel up and drop off. It was bloodless and a far less painful method of castration than the old method of cutting had been, but it had to be done when the calf was small or it wouldn't work. As soon as the calf was set free, Judd loosened the tension on his rope and slipped it off the horns of the mama cow in question. She bellowed loudly, which brought her baby running, and off they trotted.<br><br>"That's the last one," Judd said as he reined in his horse.<br><br>"Hey, boss, looks like you've got company."<br><br>Judd turned in the saddle. When he recognized Savannah's car, he frowned. She was driving fast, which meant something was wrong.<br><br>"Three of you clean up here, then take a load of hay over to the back forty and feed the yearlings. Pete, take my horse to the barn. Brush her down good, and then make sure she has food and water. I'll be back later."<br><br>He dismounted, handed over the reins and started toward the house. He was there by the time she pulled up and parked, and he could tell by the look on her face that she wasn't happy. As she got out of the car, her body language worried him even more.<br><br><i>What the hell happened?</i><br><br>"Hi, sugar." He opened his arms. She walked into his embrace without a word, burying her face against his chest. "What's wrong?"<br><br>"We need to talk."<br><br>Everything had been turned upside down since Andrew's sudden death, and he assumed this was more of the same.<br><br>"Let's go inside. I have a fire going in the den and some chili I could heat up. Are you hungry?"<br><br>Savannah shrugged. It was after three, and she realized they'd all skipped lunch, which wasn't so surprising, considering what had been happening.<br><br>"I guess. Are you?"<br><br>He grinned as they walked up the steps and into the house. "Remember who you're talking to."<br><br>Savannah smiled, trying to keep up with his humor. "Right. Sure, I'll eat with you."<br><br>The busywork of heating chili, filling bowls and making coffee dispelled some of Savannah's nervousness. By the time they sat down, the butterflies in her stomach were barely fluttering. After all, this was Judd. She'd loved him forever. She knew her unexpected news wouldn't affect him nearly as much as the fact that she intended to leave Montana, and still without committing to an engagement.<br><br>By the time they sat down, Judd was the one who was anxious. He'd never seen Savannah like this. He waited until she'd taken a bite before he followed suit. They ate in silence. Finally she shoved her bowl aside and leaned her elbows on the table.<br><br>"We got a big shock during the reading of the will."<br><br>Judd frowned. He'd known that was happening this morning, but no one had been expecting any surprises. "What kind of shock?"<br><br>Savannah clutched her hands together to keep them from shaking.<br><br>"Andrew wasn't my real father."<br><br>It was the last thing he had expected her to say. "You're kidding!"<br><br>"I wish. But that's not all. None of the three of us are real sisters."<br><br>A tear rolled out of her eye and down her cheek. The sight of it cut Judd to the bone.<br><br>"Savannah...sweetheart, I'm so sorry." He got out of his chair and quickly circled the table, pulling her up and into his arms. "So you guys were adopted. That's not such a big deal, is it?"<br><br>"If only that were the case," Savannah said. "But... we were never adopted. Not legally. It's all a big complicated mess, but he left each of us a journal explaining how we came to live with him and what happened to our real parents. Remember he used to be an evangelical preacher? And that he traveled all over the States holding revivals?"<br><br>"Yes, I knew he'd done that when he was younger. Why?"</p><h2>Scholastic - 3rd GRADE Workbook with Motivational Stickers (Scholastic Success With)</h2><p>Scholastic - 3rd GRADE Workbook with Motivational Stickers (Scholastic Success With).

For more than thirty years between 1873 and 1905, Winslow Homer turned to watercolors during his working vacations, concentrating on capturing the spirit of each place he visited with both spontaneity and intensity. Many of Homer&#x2019;s most beautiful paintings focus on the interaction between humans and nature&#x2014;a hunter carrying a deer on his shoulders, a man fishing from a small canoe, a girl lounging and reading in the grass, a young man driving cattle, a fisherman&#x2019;s family anxiously watching for his return. It is Homer&#x2019;s understanding of this important relationship between humans and nature that makes his paintings so intriguing. Winslow Homer Watercolors reproduces the best of these paintings. Large color plates allow these reproductions to be appreciated almost as much as the originals. Accompanying the more than 100 color plates is an eloquent introduction and detailed chronology of Homer&#x2019;s life and artistic development. This stunning volume allows one to experience nature through the eyes of one of America&#x2019;s greatest painters. It is a vision of nature from a century ago that is still appreciated today.</p><p>Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., is senior curator emeritus, American and British Painting, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

According to historian Gary Clayton Anderson, however, the United States has its own legacy of ethnic cleansing, and it involves American Indians.<br><br> In <i>Ethnic Cleansing and the Indian, </i>Anderson uses ethnic cleansing as an analytical tool to challenge the alluring idea that Anglo-American colonialism in the New World constituted genocide. Beginning with the era of European conquest, Anderson employs definitions of ethnic cleansing developed by the United Nations and the International Criminal Court to reassess key moments in the Anglo-American dispossession of American Indians.<br><br> Euro-Americans&#x2019; extensive use of violence against Native peoples is well documented. Yet Anderson argues that the inevitable goal of colonialism and U.S. Indian policy was not to exterminate a population, but to obtain land and resources from the Native peoples recognized as having legitimate possession. The clashes between Indians, settlers, and colonial and U.S. governments, and subsequent dispossession and forcible migration of Natives, fit the modern definition of ethnic cleansing.<br><br> To support the case for ethnic cleansing over genocide, Anderson begins with English conquerors&#x2019; desire to push Native peoples to the margin of settlement, a violent project restrained by the Enlightenment belief that all humans possess a &#x201c;natural right&#x201d; to life. Ethnic cleansing comes into greater analytical focus as Anderson engages every major period of British and U.S. Indian policy, especially armed conflict on the American frontier where government soldiers and citizen militias alike committed acts that would be considered war crimes today.<br><br> Drawing on a lifetime of research and thought about U.S.-Indian relations, Anderson analyzes the Jacksonian &#x201c;Removal&#x201d; policy, the gold rush in California, the dispossession of Oregon Natives, boarding schools and other &#x201c;benevolent&#x201d; forms of ethnic cleansing, and land allotment. Although not amounting to genocide, ethnic cleansing nevertheless encompassed a host of actions that would be deemed criminal today, all of which had long-lasting consequences for Native peoples.</p><p><b>Gary Clayton Anderson,</b> Professor of History at the University of Oklahoma, is author of <i>The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820&#x2013;1875</i>. His book <i>The Indian Southwest, 1580&#x2013;1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention</i> won the Angie Debo Prize and the publication award from the San Antonio Conservation Society."Gary Clayton Anderson has uttered the words that most American historians have, for a variety of reasons, been unwilling to use.

Nothing in Harry's thirty-eight years suggested that he was capable of such a horrendous act. Yet he would become an extreme example of the havoc caused by medication madness.Everything was going well with Harry's wife and family. After the catastrophe, many family and friends confirmed to me that Harry's marriage was a model for others; in his brother's words, "the best in the family." Meanwhile, it was Harry's most successful year financially. He owned a small business and expected to continue making a comfortable living. He was known for his meticulous work and his scrupulous honesty. Since he and his wife Cindy did most of the work, he had limited expenses, and he was generous to the relatives he employed.Harry was an elder of his church with considerable responsibility for administration and teaching. He and Cindy had no children; their family was the church and the community surrounding it.When Harry's mother- and father-in-law needed a place to live, he encouraged them to buy the duplex adjoining his own house, and then he went to work renovating it free of charge. His wife hadn't pushed him into it. That's the way Harry was: he saw a need and he tried to take care of it.In my many years of forensic work as a psychiatrist and medical expert, I have rarely conducted so many wholeheartedly positive face-to-face interviews and read so many laudatory testimonial letters about an individual. Somany people were eager to tell me about his good qualities, I had to meet with them as a group in Harry and Cindy's kitchen. Harry wasn't there because he was languishing in jail.Did Harry need to be in jail? Was he violence prone? As far as I could ascertain, the only time Harry ever displayed aggression was at age fifteen: A classmate called his girlfriend a "bitch" while she was standing beside him and Harry hit the boy without inflicting serious injury.Harry had to rise above an abusive childhood. His alcoholic father and beleaguered mother barely took care of him and his brothers and sisters. If Harry were the self-congratulatory sort, he could have exuded pride at being a self-made man. Instead, his childhood left him with a Lincoln-esque sadness. He had accepted these "blue" feelings as "just the way I am," and no one who knew him described him as depressed.Not viewing himself as depressed, Harry never considered seeking treatment until he happened to visit his family doctor for an annoying gastrointestinal problem. The problem eventually went away but something else happened that day in the doctor's waiting room--something that would forever change his life and the lives around him. Harry noticed a flyer about depression and its treatment. Couched as an "educational" brochure and prominently displayed in the doctor's office, it was really an advertising pamphlet for a pharmaceutical product. For the first time in his life, Harry thought, "Maybe I'm depressed."Harry was dealing with two stressors in his life: in-laws who were making excessive demands on him, and his own mother who was dying of Alzheimer's disease. In his criminal case, I wrote to the court, "It is no exaggeration to say that all of these problems were related to his sense of altruism and responsibility; none of them were selfish or self-centered in nature."Following his physical, which revealed nothing to be worried about, Harry talked briefly to the physician's assistant about feeling "blue" on and off for much of his life. Although Harry does not recall being at all suicidal or reporting such feelings to the doctor, the medical record states that he had some suicidal feelings in recent times. But never in his life had Harry experienced anything remotely like the compulsive drive toward violence that would soon overcome him.Harry walked out of the medical office with a prescription for Paxil 20 mg per day. Paxil is one of the commonly used Prozac copycats that also include Celexa, Lexapro, Luvox, and Zoloft (see table I in appendix A). All are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that block the normal removal of the neurotransmitter serotonin from its active site in between neurons in thebrain. Among them, in my clinical experience, Paxil is the antidepressant most often implicated in acts of violence and suicide.One month later, Harry's prescription was increased to 30 mg and then 40 mg per day over a one-week period, well within the suggested dose range for treating depression. However, most negative psychiatric reactions to antidepressants occur within the routine dosages, often when the dose has been recently changed, either up or down.HARRY ON PAXILAT THE TIME, Harry's wife Cindy did not connect the changes in her husband with his starting Paxil, but in retrospect it became clear. Usually, he was very gentle and considerate, a model husband, but now he sometimes became irritable. On one occasion he shocked Cindy by gesturing obscenely at a driver who had cut him off. Again, out of character for him, Harry cried uncontrollably while visiting his ailing mother and on another occasion burst unaccountably into tears on a weekend vacation. He also showed a maniclike lack of judgment, buying worthless or extravagant items at auctions, including a car the family didn't need. Again, this was not typical behavior for Harry Henderson.Antidepressants frequently cause overstimulation of the brain and mind, ranging from insomnia and mild agitation to psychotic levels of mania. They can also drive compulsive behaviors. Harry would display all of these behaviors while taking Paxil.Harry ran out of Paxil for one day and "crashed," sleeping for two days, but he had no idea this was a drug-withdrawal reaction. His doctor had failed to warn him about that eventuality and Harry did not check other sources of drug information. Of all the side effects Harry experienced, sexual dysfunction was the only one his doctor had mentioned to him and was, therefore, the only one Harry could identify as drug-related.One friend who saw Harry several days a week at church activities noticed that Harry was "nervous and agitated," "fidgety," "forgetful," and "like a radio turned to all channels." But in general, Harry managed to keep his inner turmoil from almost everyone who knew him.Eight months after starting on Paxil, Harry's dose was again increased, this time to 60 mg per day, somewhat above the recommended maximum of 50 mg per day for depression, but well within medical practice habits. Harry's mental state drastically worsened. He felt a growing, compulsive desire to put a stop to the strange pain inside his head, one of the most agonizing anddifficult-to-describe adverse effects of the newer antidepressants like Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac, and Celexa.Harry began to think that his wife would also be better off dying, because "it wasn't right" to leave her behind to feel guilty and to suffer. Killing her and then killing himself was the morally correct thing to do. But the idea of harming her became so intolerable that he focused instead on destroying himself.These impulses came out of the blue. Harry had none of the risk factors commonly found in people who become desperately suicidal. He was not abusing drugs or alcohol; he was not elderly; he did not suffer from a debilitating physical illness; he had not experienced a severe loss, trauma, or death of a loved one; and his business and finances were sound. Although Harry may have told his doctor that he had experienced suicidal feelings in the past, he never made suicidal threats or attempts. He was feeling pressured by his in-laws to work on their house and his mother was dying of Alzheimer's but everyone who knew him agreed that Harry had been handling these stresses without displaying unusual strain. Over the years, his depressed feelings had been relatively mild and at no time debilitating.Harry began to search for a way to obtain a gun to kill himself. After failing in his attempts to purchase a pistol, he imagined finding a police officer on a bicycle. He could push over the officer's bike and seize his gun to kill himself. Harry drove around the city but could not find any cops on bikes. Besides, he felt no animosity toward the police and had donated money to the local police department. His brother-in-law was a fireman, a job that Harry associated in a positive way with the police force.Then, Harry got a new idea. It made perfect sense at the time because it would pose no risk to others. He would break into a police car to get a shotgun; that way he wouldn't have to hurt anyone else. So he began driving toward the town police station where he knew he could find parked patrol cars. He was determined to get a gun without doing any harm to a policeman.When interviewing Harry in jail, I inquired about his knowledge of guns. He had never handled one and had no idea about differences between automatic shotguns and pump guns, or what might be required to fire them. He had no idea if he could manipulate a long gun barrel into position to shoot himself. He was equally ignorant about handguns. He had no notion about safety catches. He didn't know that he would have to slide back a chamber to cock an automatic handgun. He was a man possessed with a mission; details or practical considerations didn't clutter Harry's mind. Fixated on his goal, nothing could stand in his way. Meanwhile, Harry had no idea that the drug was driving his wholly out-of-character behavior.Before turning onto the street toward the police station, Harry happened to spot a patrol car parked by the side of the road down the block. A policeman sat in the car, apparently writing a traffic ticket for a driver he had pulled over to the curb ahead of him. Now a new impulse took over Harry. He stealthily drove his car into a parking area near the police car.The policeman sat in his car with the turret lights flashing, ignorant of the fact that a man was planning to assault him most violently. Meanwhile, Harry's compulsion had completely seized him. In his own words he had "tunnel vision." He felt mesmerized: "All I could see was the red lights flashing like I was zonked out. All I could think was I can't stand this anymore--I got to do this."Harry sat waiting in his car with the engine idling until the policeman began to open the door to his cruiser. Perhaps fifteen or twenty feet separated them. The moment the man's feet hit the pavement, Harry went into action. Keeping his left foot pressed on the brake for an instant, he pumped down hard on the gas pedal to rev up the engine. As the policeman turned wide-eyed in his direction, Harry burned rubber and drove his car into the officer, knocking him flat to the ground, and bashing in the side of his patrol car.Next, Harry backed his car off of the prostrate man, leaped out, and heard the officer calling out, "He's trying to kill me." Harry bent over and tried to reassure him, "I just want your gun. I just want your gun." He wanted the cop to know that he wished him no harm.Harry's memory is mostly blank for the next minute or two. He remembers someone restraining his arm as he tried to grapple for the officer's gun. He heard someone saying, "Oh, he's going for his gun." He envisioned getting the gun, pushing it into his own body, and pulling the trigger. He next remembers someone holding him down. Two men had intervened to drag him off the policeman.The policeman was badly injured. He was cut, bruised, and shocked. One of his legs was broken. But with the help of good Samaritans, he fought off the crazed stranger who was trying to grab his gun from his holster.During this horrendously violent assault on the officer, Harry--a man known for his gentle, caring nature--had given no thought to the harm he was inflicting on another human being. "I wasn't thinking about anything but dying. I obviously didn't think about consequences for anyone else." He had no plan for escaping or he wouldn't have run his own car into the cruiser. He felt compelled to end his life on the spot, then and there, at any cost.After the assault was over, Harry failed to grasp the enormity of what he had done, nearly crippling or killing an innocent person, an officer of the lawwhose position he ordinarily held in respect. Later, after the Paxil effects began to wear off, Harry grew dismayed and remorseful. He became Harry Henderson again--and yet his life would never be the same. The man who had suffered from excessive feelings of responsibility for others throughout most of his life now had something really dreadful to feel guilty about. He entered into a period of deep depression.Unexpectedly, the policeman Harry had assaulted came to Harry's legal rescue. After reading my detailed scientific evaluation of Paxil's capacity to cause compulsive, violent suicide, and my clinical analysis of Harry's particular case, the policeman decided that Harry was the victim of medication madness and should be dealt with leniently.In mid-2002, when Harry Henderson drove his car into the policeman, there was hardly another psychiatrist in America who would have taken his case. Nearly all were in denial, and most remain in denial, about the capacity of antidepressants to drive people over the edge. Even today, after the FDA has acknowledged that the newer antidepressants like Paxil and Prozac cause suicidality, there are only very few psychiatrists with the combination of expertise and determination required to take a stand in court against powerful drug-company interests. If I hadn't intervened in Harry Henderson's case, he might have spent much of the rest of his life in jail. Instead, my analysis of his case led the prosecution and the judge, as well as the injured policeman, to rethink their attitudes regarding their originally tough stance toward Harry. He was allowed to plead to a lesser charge that resulted in his release from jail after a relatively short stay.Several months after the resolution of his case, Harry drove a considerable distance with his wife to see me to get help in dealing with the emotional aftermath of what had happened to him. The law had forgiven him more readily than he could forgive himself. With additional help from a local counselor and from his wife, it took Harry more than a year to begin his recovery from disabling guilt over what he had done. I am hopeful that some day he will feel fully recovered from the emotional aftereffects of his bout with medication madness, but it will take time.SPELLBOUND BY PAXILMEDICATION SPELLBINDING occurs along a continuum from mild to severe, and Harry was driven into extreme madness. His reactions on Paxil displayed all four aspects of spellbinding by medication:� His mental condition deteriorated without his appreciating it.� He had no idea that his psychiatric drug had anything to do with what was happening to him.� Although he was getting worse, he at times thought he was doing better than ever, especially when he became euphoric and went on spending sprees.� Ultimately, he developed compulsive, destructive behaviors that took over and ruined his life.DID HARRY "GET AWAY WITH IT?"HARRY HIMSELF FOUND it hard to believe that a drug could have made him do such terrible t...</p><h2>Theroux: Collected Stories</h2><p>More than sixty short stories by the renowned author of My Other Life portray students, diplomats, academics, and other characters in such locales as Africa, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Theroux is nothing if not prolific. His travel books are some of the world's most popular, while his novels, including most recently<i> Kowloon Tong</i> , both please and provoke. And all the time he's been working on his 20-odd books, Theroux has been writing short stories, high-strung tales of intriguing psychological and cultural complexity that reflect his long sojourn in England and his extensive wanderings. This substantial collection of more than 60 compelling stories spans 25 years and represents, as Theroux confides in his edgy introduction, the essence of his "imaginative task as a writer." His stories are also, he declares, "better than me," a poignant conviction rooted in his perpetual loneliness, the force that propelled him to the many locales he so deftly conjures. Theroux's own preference for places where his work as a writer matters little in comparison to his skills as a traveler, hiker, or kayaker is echoed in the psyches of his characters, many of whom feel trapped in their lives, especially their marriages. As Theroux spins tales set in Africa, Boston, China, Corsica, England, India, Patagonia, and Prague, he examines differences in place and perspective, but finds, beneath it all, the same emotional skeleton, the same sense of alienation and melancholia. As flinty as the predicaments he renders are, they manage, under the right conditions, to give off sparks of bright humor and flares of love. <i>Donna Seaman</i>The prolific Theroux (My Other Life, 1996, etc.) has published four volumes of short stories. This omnibus gathers all but two of the tales from Sinning with Annie (1972), The Consul's File (1977), World's End (1980), and The London Embassy (1983), and adds several previously uncollected stories. The collection forcefully demonstrates that Theroux, although he has written some unsettling and provocative novels, is often at his best as a writer of short fiction: His fascination with the ways in which a gesture or simple event can reveal the essentials of character, his shrewd eye for the rich resonance of seemingly modest events (especially when mutually uncomprehending Westerners and Africans and Asians collide), and his obvious pleasure in the constraints of a short story, the necessity for an economical use of language and incident, are all powerfully on display here. Tales like ``Clapham Junction,'' ``Sinning with Annie,'' ``Conspirators,'' and ``The Exile,'' among many others, are strong, unsettling, and unique. A varied, powerful, often moving collection, then, by one of our most original and ambitious authors. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Set in the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of Ilium by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles. Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, the Iliad mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege. Along with the Odyssey, also attributed to Homer, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, and its written version is usually dated to around the eighth century BC.[1] The Iliad contains over 25,000 lines, and is written in a literary amalgam of several Greek dialects.</p><p><p><b> A Look Inside: <em>The Iliad</em> [Click Images to Enlarge]</b></p> <i>First Seven Lines of the Iliad</i>: This reconstruction is based on what we know about the earliest Greek orthography. <p> </p> <i>The Walls of Troy</i>: The translator standing before the walls of the sixth city at Troy. <p> </p> <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>: On the right a youthful Paris sits on a stone in a rural location.

Chatal Hoyuk, in what is now south central Turkey, was excavated in the early 1960s and turned out to be one of the very first places that could be called a city. The excavators found evidence of a well-established agriculture, trade, and religion, all dating back to near the end of the Stone Age. Other archaeologists' efforts in Turkey have resulted in the discovery of the ancient empire of the Hittites, lost to history for centuries. These and several other little-known and understood civilizations are described. Numerous full-color photographs and illustrations add an extra dimension to the text.

But instead of living in safety, in the small community of free people, they have chosen to embark upon a mission that may cost them their lives.</p><p><p><br> <b>John Christopher</b> (Sam Youd) was born in England in April 1922, during an unseasonable snowstorm. His early years were spent in Lancashire and Hampshire. He left school at sixteen to work as a local government clerk until being called up for army service in 1941, and spent the following four and a half years with the Royal Corps of Signals, in Gibraltar, North Africa, Italy, and Austria. </p><p> On leaving the army he renewed a teenage ambition toward being a writer, and in 1947, on the basis of an unfinished novel, won an Atlantic Award, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to devote himself to writing for a year. He tried to justify the award by writing serious novels, but subsequently also wrote detective thrillers, light comedies, novels based on cricket, and science fiction, to which he had been passionately devoted in his early teens. After several adult science fiction novels, he was asked to write for the young adult field, and ended up writing sixteen books in that genre, including <i>The Guardians, The Lotus Caves, Dom and Va, Empty World,</i> and the Sword and Fireball trilogies, as well as the Tripods trilogy. Following a BBC television series in 1984 based on the Tripods books, he wrote a prequel, <i>When the Tripods Came,</i> explaining how it all came about. </p><p> Sam Youd is a widower with five children and numerous grandchildren, and lives in Rye, in the county of Sussex, England.</p><p><br> Chapter One: Three Are Chosen </p><p><br> Even when we first came to the White Mountains, in summer, the upper reaches of the Tunnel looked out over fields of snow and ice; but at the lower end there were rocks and grass and a view of the glacier, stained brown with mud and dripping into rivulets that ran down to the valley, far far below. In September there was a fall of snow which did not lie, but in the early days of October the snow came again, more heavily, and this time remained. The grip of winter tightened around us, and it was to be more than half a year before those white bony fingers unclenched. </p><p> Preparations for the siege had been made long before. Food had been stored, cattle and winter fodder taken into the inner recesses of the mountain which sheltered us. We did not need a great deal by way of heat, protected as we were by dozens, hundreds of yards of solid rock. Cool in summer, our deep caves were warm, by comparison, in winter. We wore furs when we were outside, but the rest of the time our normal clothing was enough. </p><p> Our lives were confined, but by no means idle. Reveille, for those of us in the training cadre, was at six, and was followed by half an hour's brisk exercise. After that came a simple breakfast, and then the first study period of the day, lasting three hours. There were more exercises before the midday meal, and in the afternoon exercise and instruction in our particular sports. If the weather were fine, this took place outside in the snow; otherwise in the Great Cavern. There was a second study period before supper, and afterward generally there was discussion among our seniors, to which we listened but in which we did not presume to join. It had one subject -- the Tripods -- and one purpose: their overthrow. </p><p><br> The Tripods had been rulers of the earth for more than a hundred years. They governed simply and effectively, by dominating the minds of men. This was achieved through the Caps, meshes of silvery metal which fitted closely around the skull and were woven into the very flesh of their wearers. Capping occurred in one's fourteenth year, marking the point at which one ceased to be a child and became an adult. It was taken for granted, an expected, looked-for thing, attended by feasting and celebration. </p><p> A few months earlier I had seen my cousin Jack, a year older than myself, go through the ceremony, and had noticed the change in him afterward. I was to be Capped the following year. I had some misgivings, but I kept them private -- no one talked much about Tripods and Cappings and, of course, no one ever queried the rightness of these things. Not, that is, until the Vagrant, Ozymandias, came to the little village where I lived. </p><p> The Vagrants were those for whom Capping had not worked properly. Their minds had refused to accept the conditioning of the Tripods and, in refusing, had been broken. They wandered from place to place, never resting long, and were looked after but pitied and disliked by normal Capped men and women. Now, though, I found myself more interested in them; particularly in the one who called himself Ozymandias, a big, red-haired, red-bearded man who sang strange songs, and spoke lines of poetry, and mixed sense and nonsense when he talked. Defying my parents, I invited him to come to the den which Jack and I had made just outside the village. He told me a strange story. </p><p> He was, in the first place, not really a Vagrant, but posing as such so that he could travel through the land, unchallenged and unremarked. The Cap he wore was a false one. He explained that the Tripods were enemies of men, not benefactors, invaders, perhaps, from another world, and how, through Capping, minds which were just beginning to think for themselves were subdued and harnessed to the worship of their oppressors. </p><p> He told me, too, that although the Tripods ruled the planet, there were a few places where free men survived, and that one of these was among the White Mountains, across the sea from England far to the south. He asked me if I would be willing to make a difficult and dangerous journey there, and I said I would. </p><p> He himself traveled on in search of more recruits, but I did not go alone. Another cousin of mine, Henry, an old antagonist since before our schooldays, saw me leaving the village and followed me. We crossed the sea together, and in the land called France found a third, Jean-Paul -- whom we named Beanpole. Together we made our way south. It was as difficult and dangerous as Ozymandias had promised. Near the end, we fought a battle with a Tripod and, by luck and a weapon of the ancients which we found in the ruins of one of the great-cities, destroyed it. </p><p> So, at last, we reached the White Mountains. </p><p><br> There were eleven of us in the training cadre, being prepared for the first move in the counterattack against our enemies. It was a hard schooling, in body and mind alike, but we knew a little of the task before us, and how heavy the odds against success were. The discipline and hardship we had to endure might not shorten those odds by much, but every bit counted. </p><p> For we -- or some of us -- were to conduct a reconnaissance. We knew almost nothing of the Tripods -- not even whether they were intelligent machines or vehicles for alien beings. We must know more before we could hope to fight them successfully; and there was only one way to get that knowledge. Some of us, one at least, must penetrate into the City of the Tripods, study them, and bring back information. The plan was this: </p><p> The City lay to the north, in the country of the Germans. Each year some of the newly Capped, chosen in different ways, were brought there to serve the Tripods. I had witnessed one such way at the Ch�&#x192;teau de la Tour Rouge, when Eloise, the daughter of the Comte, had been made Queen of the Tournament. I had been horrified to learn that at the end of her brief reign she should want to be taken to be a slave of the enemy, and go gladly, thinking it an honor. </p><p> Among the Germans, it seemed, there were Games each summer, to which young men came from hundreds of miles away. The winners were feasted and made much of after which they, too, went to serve in the City. At the next Games, it was hoped, one of us might win, and gain admission. What would happen after that was unknown. Anyone who succeeded would have to rely on his wits, both in spying on the Tripods and in passing on what he had learned. The last part was likely to be the hardest. Because although scores, perhaps hundreds, went yearly into the City, not one had ever been known to come out. </p><p><br> One day the snow was melting at the foot of the Tunnel where we exercised, and a week later it lay only in isolated patches, and there was the green of grass, dotted with purple crocuses. The sky was blue, and sunlight flamed from the white peaks all round, burning our skins through the thin pure air. During a break we lay on the grass and looked down. Figures moved cautiously half a mile below, visible to us but taking cover from those who might look up from the valley. This was the first raiding party of the season, on its way to plunder the fat lands of the Capped. </p><p> I sat with Henry and Beanpole, a little apart from the rest. The lives of all those who lived in the mountains were closely knit, but this strand was a more tightly woven one. In the things we had endured, jealousies and enmities had worn away and been replaced by true comradeship. The boys in the cadre were our friends, but the bond between us three was special. </p><p> Beanpole said gloomily, "I failed at one meter seventy today." </p><p> He spoke in German; we had learned the language but needed to practice it. I said, "One goes off form. You'll improve again." </p><p> "I'm getting worse every day." </p><p> Henry said, "Rodrigo's definitely gone off. I beat him comfortably." </p><p> "It's all right for you." </p><p> Henry had been chosen as a long-distance runner, and Rodrigo was his chief rival. Beanpole was training for long and high jumping. I was one of two boxers. There were four sports altogether -- the other was sprint running -- and they had been arranged to produce a maximum of competitiveness. Henry had done well in his event from the start. And I myself was fairly confident, at any rate, as far as my opponent here was concerned. This was Tonio, a dark-skinned boy from the south, taller than I and with a longer reach, but not as quick. Beanpole, though, had grown increasingly pessimistic about his chances. </p><p> Henry reassured him, telling him he had heard the instructors saying he was coming on well. I wondered if it were true, or said for encouragement: the former, I hoped. </p><p> I said, "I asked Johann if it had been decided yet how many were to go." </p><p> Johann, one of the instructors, was squat and powerful, yellow-haired, with the look of a bad-tempered bull but amiable at heart. Henry asked, "What did he say?" </p><p> "He wasn't sure, but he thought four -- the best from each group." </p><p> "So it could be us three, plus an extra," Henry said. </p><p> Beanpole shook his head. "I'll never do it." </p><p> "You will." </p><p> I said, "And the fourth?" </p><p> "It might be Fritz." </p><p> He did seem to be the best of the sprint runners, as far as we could tell. He was German himself, and came from a place on the edge of a forest to the northeast. His chief rival was a French boy, Etienne, whom I preferred. Etienne was cheerful and talkative, Fritz tall, heavy, taciturn. </p><p> I said, "As long as we all come through." </p><p> "You two will," Beanpole said. </p><p> Henry leaped to his feet. "There's the whistle. Come on, Beanpole. Time to get back to work." </p><p><br> The seniors had their own tasks. Some were our instructors; others formed the raiding parties to keep us supplied with food. There were still others who studied the few books that had survived from olden days, and tried to relearn the skills and mysteries of our ancestors. Beanpole, whenever he had a chance, would be with them, listening to their talk and even putting up suggestions of his own. Not long after we met he had spoken -- wildly, as I thought -- about using a sort of gigantic kettle to push carriages without the need for horses. Something like this had been discovered, or rediscovered, here, though it would not yet work properly. And there were plans for more remarkable things: making light and heat through something which had been called electricity was one. </p><p> And at the head of all the groups there was one man, whose hands held all the threads, whose decisions were unquestioned. This was Julius. </p><p> He was close on sixty years old, a small man and a cripple. When he was a boy he had fallen into an ice crevasse and broken his thigh: it had been set badly and he walked with a limp. In those days, things had been very different in the White Mountains. Those who lived there had no purpose but survival, and their numbers were dwindling. It was Julius who thought of winning recruits from the world outside, from those not yet Capped, and who believed -- and made others believe -- that some day men would fight back against the Tripods, and destroy them. </p><p> It was Julius, too, who had worked out the enterprise for which we were being trained. And it was Julius who would make the final decision on which of us were chosen. </p><p> He came out one day to watch us. He was white-haired, red-cheeked like most of those who had lived all their lives in this sharp, clear air, and he leaned on a stick. I saw him, and concentrated hard on the bout in which I was engaged. Tonio feinted with his left, and followed up with a right cross. I made him miss, hammered a sharp right to his ribs and, when he came in again, landed a left to the jaw which sent him sprawling. </p><p> Julius beckoned, and I ran to where he stood. He said, "You are improving, Will." </p><p> "Thank you, sir." </p><p> "I suppose you are getting impatient to know which of you will be going to the Games?" </p><p> I nodded. "A little, sir." </p><p> He studied me. "When the Tripod had you in its grasp -- do you remember how you felt? Were you afraid?" </p><p> I remembered. I said, "Yes, sir." </p><p> "And the thought of being in their hands, in their City -- does that frighten you?" I hesitated, and he went on: "There are two sides to the choice, you know. We old ones may be able to judge your quickness and skill, of mind and body, but we cannot read your hearts." </p><p> "Yes," I admitted, "it frightens me." </p><p> "You do not have to go. You can be useful here." His pale blue eyes looked into mine. "No one need know if you prefer to stay." </p><p> I said, "I want to go. I can bear the thought of being in their hands more easily than of being left behind." </p><p> "Good." He smiled. "And you, after all, have killed a Tripod -- something I doubt any other human being can claim. You know that they are not all-powerful. That is an asset, Will." </p><p> "Do you mean, sir...?" </p><p> "I mean what I said. There are other considerations. You must go on working hard, and preparing, in case you are chosen." </p><p> Later I saw him talking to Henry. I thought it was probably much the same conversation as mine had been. I did not ask him, though, and he did not volunteer anything about it. </p><p><br> During the winter our diet, although adequate, had been very dull, the staple item dried and salted meat, which, however hard the cooks tried, remained stodgy and unappetizing. In the middle of April, though, a raiding party brought back half a dozen black-and-white cows, and Julius decreed that one should be killed and roasted. After the feast, he spoke to us. When he had been talking a few minutes I realized, the excitement almost suffocating me, that this, almost certainly, was the moment for announcing the names of those who were to make the attempt at penetrating the City of the Tripods. </p><p> He had a quiet voice, and I was with the other boys at the far end of the cave, but his words were clear. Everyone was listening, attentively and in silence. I glanced at Henry, on my right. In the flickering light, I thought he looked very confident. My own confidence was ebbing rapidly. It would be bitter if he went, and I were left. </p><p> First, Julius talked about the plan in general. For months those in the training cadre had been preparing for their task. They would have some advantage over competitors from lower lands, because it was known that men in higher altitudes developed stronger lungs and muscles than those who lived in the thicker air. But it had to be remembered that there would be hundreds of competitors, drawn from the best athletes all over the country. It might be that, for all their preparation, not one of our small band would wear a champion's belt. In that case, they must find their way back to the White Mountains, and try again, next year. Patience was as necessary as determination. </p><p> Contestants in the Games must be Capped, of course. That presented no great difficulty. We had Caps, taken from those killed in forays into the valleys, which could be molded to fit the skulls of the ones chosen. They would look like Caps, but they would give no orders. Here, though, a problem did present itself. </p><p> We who had never been Capped could not know just how men's minds were controlled by them.

An MFA graduate in performing, her extensive theatrical background includes ten years as a member of The Irondale Ensemble, during which she had leading roles in both original works and in productions of Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekov, and Brecht. She continues to act and direct at venues in the New York City area. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br>&nbsp;One would think that "moving" would be as natural as falling off a log, and yet when we stand in front of an audience, our hands grow large and heavy and our feet root to the floor. Marshall (physical acting, Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, London) and the contributors to the collection by Potter (theater, Marymount Manhattan Coll.) are well aware of this problem and take different approaches to solving it. Marshall tends to focus on the inner being and the actor's inner response. Concepts such as "finding the center," "discovering the rhythm," and "focusing your energy" are cited throughout, along with physical and practical exercises and activities that will help actors use their bodies effectively to communicate with the audience. As a collection, Potter's book offers a variety of viewpoint and focus. For example, Mary Fleischer's article is about stillness-how to be silent, respond, return to stillness, and so on-while Marianne Kubik discusses Meyerhold's system of training actors and body movement. Theresa Lee examines the Alexander Technique. In all, there are 23 articles and almost as many approaches to body movement. Interestingly, both books discuss the importance of the synthesis of body and mind, discipline and spontaneity, and knowledge and instinct. Both works are highly recommended for all library theater collections and large public libraries.<br><i>Susan L.

Each is a tale of disappointed love, of men catching but never able to keep the women they love in a setting where corruption is endemic and Filipino nationalists struggle to promote a national identity under assault from both the US and Japan. In ``Cadeno De Amor,'' Eddie analyses the rise of Narita Reyes, a childhood friend, whom he was later to advise in her successful political campaigns. Driven by her desire to escape the humiliations of her childhood poverty, Narita marries well and is soon a prot&#x201a;g&#x201a; of her wealthy father-in-law, who funds her Senate campaign--an expensive business, for, as Eddie notes, everyone from journalists to local officials must be bribed. Even Eddie, who loves her, begins to believe ``that nothing much could be done about our political malaise until she had real power.'' And when the elected Narita dies in a bizarre accident, the ``mythmakers'' are ready. It is still politics as usual. In the second story, ``Obsession,'' a wealthy Filipino business man is in love with the enigmatic prostitute Ermi, who defends her way of life and decision to marry an American by asking him whether she ``has ever stolen from anyone like those big people whom you know and serve.'' The young protagonist of the third piece, ``Platinum,'' loves and loses beautiful Malu--a young woman of good family who's at ease only when ``trying to help people'' and who, wanting to do something useful with her life, becomes a member of an underground guerilla movement, then dies in a raid. Schematically awkward but redeemed by vivid local color, and imbued with a palpable but unsentimental concern for the author's country. A promising introduction. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Until now, the work of Jose, an author ( My Brother, My Executioner ), editor and head of the Manila PEN center, has been all but unavailable in the U.S. The novellas in this collection purport to explore the character of a Filipina and, by extension, the nation: Narita in "Cadena de Amor," who rises to power from provincial origins; Ermi in "Obsession," who leaves her career as an expensive call girl to marry a rich American; and Malu in "Platinum," who dares to live up to her ideals as a political activist. More vivid than the women, however, are the men who tell their stories, hard-edged characters who take for granted the tangles of personality and sexuality permeating modern-day Manila's politics-and business-as-usual. Nontheless, each hopes for a transcendent experience with the woman who fascinates him--but cannot escape the sense of his own corruption, "the onslaught of the malaise that had battered most of us, the dishonesty, the deceit that pervaded public life." Unable to connect except sexually, the men regard the women like children before a candy store, alternately tantalized and frustrated. Readers, in turn, will be tantalized by these glimpses of lives led on the margins of the elite. Jose's elegiac tone complements his narratives of the loneliness and loss that accompany disillusionment. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bulletproof: The Cookbook</h2><p><p><strong>The Bulletproof Way of Life: More Butter, Less Exercise and Better Sleep for the Body and Brain You Deserve</strong></p><p>In his #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>The Bulletproof Diet</em>, Dave Asprey shows how ditching traditional &#x201c;diet&#x201d; thinking can help you lose weight, boost your IQ and increase your energy.

You may listen to every episode of Bulletproof Radio, read every word on the Bulletproof blog, and constantly refine your program to achieve optimal performance. You may even decide to skip straight to the recipes because you've seen the incredible results the Bulletproof approach offers, and you just can't wait to get straight to the delicious Bulletproof food. And that's OK. However, whether you're new to Bulletproof or an experienced biohacker, take the time to read this opening chapter as a reminder of why we do what we do, and a refresher for the basic principles that define being Bulletproof.<br><br>First and foremost, this is a cookbook, a collection of Bulletproof recipes designed to make eating within the plan easy and satisfying, not to mention enjoyable. But before we roll up our sleeves to get into ingredients and food preparation, I'd like to underscore the foundational ideas that informed the creation of the recipes and also answer some common questions about the Bulletproof Diet. If you're new to all things Bulletproof, this chapter will give you a solid orientation to the philosophy, research, and goals that lead to the Bulletproof state of high performance. These are lessons with the power to change your life. Becoming Bulletproof isn't a quick fix or a fad; it's a new way to understand your physical state and tweak it to bring out unforeseen levels of energy and functionality.<br><br>It's not about being invincible. It's about adding so much to your energy and willpower reserves that you feel you can "bring it" no matter what life brings your way. For me, when I weighed 300 �ds, I honestly felt I didn't have that strength or control. Now, my joy and potential feel limitless. Becoming Bulletproof is about your true resilience, and realizing that you can do anything you set out to accomplish.<br><br>So before we get into recipes, let me outline the top tenets of the approach, and boil it down to basics to help organize the most important takeaways. The following sections will give you a good 101 understanding of what it is we're doing here, and why it works. From the top, here are the most common questions I'm asked about the Bulletproof Diet.<br><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE BULLETPROOF?<br><br>Becoming Bulletproof is, in the simplest terms, about making you the most powerful being you can be, in terms of physical performance, brain power, and all-day energy. That means getting the very best out of your body and brain, all of the time. When I started this quest, I weighed 300 �ds. And while I was a fabulously successful entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, my physical and mental state was in sad shape. Because I had a background in tech, I understood the concept of hacking in a very real way. I had personal experience encountering barriers and boundaries and learning how to decode and work around them. So I employed that same approach in trying to figure out and conquer my weight problem and foggy brain. I believed on a gut level that there were ways to decode my system and create workarounds that would give me greater control over my system--not to outsmart it, but to understand its inner workings and optimize the functionality that my body, in its best state, could deliver.<br><br>As it turned out, this approach changed my life--and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people after me. All of my methods are driven by the idea that we are constantly refining and learning about what works for us personally, and making small tweaks--just as one does in technology--to make our bodies smarter, stronger, and more robust. There is no magic bullet. But if you can reset your body to cut your cravings, you'll change the state of your body and mind.<br><br>WILL THE BULLETPROOF DIET HELP ME LOSE WEIGHT?<br><br>Yes, being Bulletproof is a way to lose weight. It transforms the body into a lean, efficient, energetic machine. But that's really only a side effect of getting your body to operate in its most efficient state. Did I want to lose weight? Hell, yes. Is that why most people try the Bulletproof Diet in the first place? Absolutely. But is that what we're really doing here? No. Becoming our best, most powerful selves means fine-tuning every system in the body, from metabolism to detoxification to brain power. And when we do that, we lose excess weight because our systems are acting as they should. They are working at max capacity while burning energy efficiently and consistently. In essence, weight loss is a byproduct of making the body function optimally. I won't lie--it's the byproduct that most of us care the most about. But a thousand other good things are happening that make the weight loss possible. That's why becoming Bulletproof creates a noticeable upswing in brain function and energy levels. That's why people report feeling amazing--the best in their lives--when eating this way. So yes, weight loss is an awesome thing. But it's not the only thing. And it's not the thing that defines Bulletproof living. Bulletproof is much more concerned with holistic success, measured by performance across a number of bodily and brain functions.<br><br>HOW DOES THE BULLETPROOF DIET WORK?<br><br>The Bulletproof Diet doesn't work like most diets--there's no calorie counting because when you stop eating foods that make you weak, you'll actually be able to hear the hormone hunger signal from your body, and you won't experience food cravings. You don't have to attempt to magically work out more than you eat, which creates unsustainable biological stress for most people. And let's remember, famines and labor camps are not great ways to build willpower or resilience. Instead, choose foods that have the right kind of energy, but are also lowest in the things that slow you down, and highest in nutrients. Then, you eat them at the time when they will do the most for your body and mind based on circadian biology. This is a far cry from most "healthy" diets, which focus on decreasing the amount of energy in your food while increasing the amount of nutrients and totally ignoring the effects of antinutrients.<br><br>The Bulletproof Diet partially falls into a category broadly known as ketogenic diets, though my plan has fewer ketones than a full-on ketogenic diet. (For you science geeks out there, it's a cyclical ketogenic diet with nutrient timing!)<br><br>You've probably heard of plans like the Atkins Diet and the Paleo Diet, which also fall under the ketogenic umbrella, but make no mistake: The Bulletproof Diet is different from those popular programs, for reasons I'll get to shortly. The thing that lumps these approaches into a single category is the way that weight loss is achieved, namely by a process called ketosis. Ketosis is a state wherein your body burns fat instead of carbs. When you think about it, this is a pretty simple proposition. Your body typically burns carbs, turning them into sugar for energy. But if your body is out of carbs, it will go to Plan B: fat burning. It's a natural function, and one that your body would employ in a natural way depending on your circumstances. If you found yourself in a situation where you were deprived of carbs, your body would know what to do, and would find an alternate energy source (read: your stored fat). The Bulletproof Diet is built around creating a ketogenic state in order to burn fat stores for energy rather than using carbs. When you carb-load, you're stockpiling your body with extra energy to use, but in the absence of those carbs, your body will burn fat, so you become leaner in the process.<br><br>IS KETOSIS SAFE?<br><br>When I was initially discovering the power of ketosis for myself, I'd heard about the so-called Eskimo diet, where almost no calories come from carbohydrates, and most calories come from fat. Nutritional alarmists will often confuse a state of metabolic ketoacidosis from diabetes with the completely natural form of ketosis from diet--it's a natural state in which the body rests. Full ketosis is used to treat epilepsy and cancer, even in kids, with great safety. In this state, your body creates carbs from proteins. For some people, this is optimal and they stay in this state for prolonged periods. For other people, like me, it makes me feel run down. This is why, for ultimate resilience--and especially for women--I recommend cycling in and out of ketosis. I recommend eating some carbs as it stresses the body to create carbs from protein. With my recommendation, you get the best of both worlds. And my recommendation is still less suggestive of a ketogenic state than most paleo diets recommend.<br><br>When I began studying ketosis, I wanted to see what would happen if I entered a ketogenic state and stuck with it indefinitely--or for three months, as was the case for me. Guess what? It wasn't good. The Inuit people subsist primarily on protein and a huge amount of fat. They live on delicacies like whale blubber and seal jerky. And good for them; they are genetically predisposed to function this way as they've evolved with this diet for centuries . . . and they live on packed snow. We, in everyday America, however, have not. After eating nothing but protein and ridiculous amounts of fats for three months, my body started malfunctioning. My sleep quality went away. My eyes and sinuses were superdry all the time. I started getting headaches. Because I didn't have enough carbohydrates to manufacture the mucus that lines a healthy stomach, I developed food allergies to my favorite foods as soon as I added them back in. I'm still working to hack the food allergies I developed by eating that way, and making great progress. Clearly for me, this state of prolonged ketosis was a terrible idea. I know that having experienced it firsthand, and I've seen lesser versions of these symptoms--especially sleep and energy problems--in a good number of Bulletproof followers who stay in ketosis for long periods, though not all of them. This is why the Bulletproof approach advocates moving in and out of a ketogenic state, always being mindful of how and when we eat carbs for added energy. For the vast majority of people, I do not advocate putting your body in a ketogenic state indefinitely.<br><br>What I do know is that you can use ketosis as a tool, in measured, regular bursts, to bring out some amazing fat-burning and brain-revving potential. That is what being Bulletproof is all about: biohacking your way to the sweet spot where your system thrives and continually outperforms itself without causing damage or detriment to your systems.<br><br>SO HOW IS THE BULLETPROOF DIET DIFFERENT FROM THE ATKINS AND PALEO PLANS?<br><br>The Bulletproof Diet recommends 6 to 11 servings of veggies a day. "Whoa" you're thinking. "That's a ridiculous amount of veggies." And you're right. Some people have a hard time adjusting to eating this many servings of veggies because it so far exceeds what we've become accustomed to in the sad state of an American diet devoid of nutrition. I'm advocating more veggies per day than most other programs, and even some vegan diets! The FDA recommends 5 servings of 1/2 cup (or 21/2 cups per day). But please note, they treat fruits and veggies as the same thing. This is a flawed approach, because fruit is mostly sugar, while vegetables are mostly nutrients and fiber. I recommend 9 servings of veggies a day and potentially a lot more. So my plan suggests at least three times more than the FDA recommends. That's important to remember, because while we're asking you to skip carbs, in measured cycles, we're also flooding your body with the amazing nutrients nature provides, and teaching you how to identify and limit carb-heavy, starchy vegetables, except when you want your body to have healthy carbohydrates. So that's the first way Bulletproof living is different from the Atkins plan.<br><br>Atkins and Paleo are both considered "low-carb high-fat" (LCHF) diets. Atkins focuses on a high-protein, high-fat eating plan to trigger ketosis, but doesn't focus on the type of fat or protein. Paleo also advocates a high-protein, high-fat diet, but it does pay attention to the type of fat and protein, which is a major improvement. But it's also high enough in protein to trigger inflammation, and the impact of cooking techniques isn't a part of the diet, even though it affects how you use your food.<br><br>The Bulletproof Diet is also an LCHF diet, like Paleo and Atkins, but it has components that set it apart entirely: namely, a focus on eliminating cravings by controlling food toxins, and eating the right foods at the right times, not to mention significant differences in Bulletproof cooking methods. People forget that cooking is a form of food processing, and you can "process" food in your own kitchen and accidentally turn it from something nutritious into something that will make you crave sugar. This should be a no-brainer, but plenty of other diets don't really take this aspect of the formula into consideration.<br><br>Other plans know that by introducing ketosis, the body will burn fat, and so they figure, mission accomplished. But if you're burning fat that's full of food toxins, you're going to experience fatigue and cravings . . . totally not Bulletproof!<br><br>The Bulletproof Diet also differs from the Atkins and Paleo diets in its attention to toxins, or antinutrients. As I was hacking my own performance, and losing 100 �ds, I learned a lot about the toxins that exist, naturally and unnaturally, in our food supply. Besides of all the manmade toxins that have entered our food chain via pesticides and manufacturing processes, there are also naturally occurring antinutrients that, while they won't kill us, can slow down or compromise our natural system functions. Take kale, for example. The darling of healthy eaters everywhere, kale is enjoying its moment in the sun. It's all the rage in salads, juices, pastas, you name it. Every hip restaurant has kale somewhere on its menu, and most markets now offer an array of heirloom varieties. Here's the thing. Kale isn't always good for all of us. It's a goitrogenic food, which means that in its raw form it interferes with iodine uptake and can cause enlargement of the thyroid (this is where the term goiter comes from). It can slow your thyroid function, which is a bad thing because your thyroid controls your energy levels.<br><br>ABOUT FOOD TOXINS</p><h2>The journal of Euge&#x300;ne Delacroix: A selection (Landmarks in art history)</h2><p>Delacroix&#39;s journal - fresh and unselfconsciously spontaneous - is one of art history&#39;s most important documents.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)&#39;Mini-triumphs of contemporary design ... the words contained within these gem-like covers are lapidary as well.&#39; (Times Literary Supplement)</p><h2>The Living and the Dead: Robert McNamara and Five Lives of a Lost War</h2><p>One of the finest books to emerge from the Vietnam experience, The Living and the Dead presents a brilliant study of Robert McNamara, his decision-making during the war, and the way his decisions affected his own life and the lives of five individuals.

(The richest vein struck in this effort thus far still has to be Gloria Emerson's Winners and Losers.) Hendrickson spent most of a decade putting together the story of the war in the lives of Robert McNamara and five less fancy participants in it--a combat Marine who once was on the cover of <i>Life</i>, an Army nurse, the scion of an upper-crust Vietnamese family, a Quaker who set fire to himself outside McNamara's Pentagon office window in 1965, and an artist who, in 1972, tried to throw McNamara over the side of the Martha's Vineyard ferry. Hendrickson's efforts to generate a sense of his characters interacting on a cosmic stage too often flirt with bathos, but his way with the characters themselves is undeniably powerful.Paul Hendrickson is a feature writer for the Washington Post.</p><h2>Les Parisiennes: How the Women of Paris Lived, Loved and Died in the 1940s</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival.

She has written eight works of non-fiction, mostly about iconic women, presented BBC radio documentaries, and is an accredited NADFAS (National Association of Decorative &amp; Fine Arts Societies) lecturer.[M]ost enticingly, in addition to uncovering some little-known stories and accounts, Sebba has contributed original research in the form of interviews with surviving participants. These bring valuable testimony from women who survived roundups, deportation and camps, resisted in various ways, witnessed arrests, battles and head-shavings, experienced privations and face complex ethical choices. Sebba approaches difficult subject matter with tact and respect, seeking to understand the decisions and motivations of women on all sides. * FRENCH HISTORY * Anne Sebba's fabulous book, Les Parisiennes, sets out to show in a remarkably non-judgmental way, how the women of Paris acted when faced with German occupation in the Second World War, and perhaps even more interestingly, how they behaved in the years immediately following ... The Spinoff's choice not just as the best book of non-fiction of 2016 but as the best book of any kind -- Linda Burgess * THE SPINOFF (NEW ZEALAND) * One of the best researched, least rabid accounts of the Vichy era -- Edmund White * TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT * 'Anne Sebba, author of a biography of Wallis Simpson, has written this vivid account, subtitled How the Women of Paris Lived, Loved and Died in the 1940s. This was after the German invasion, which brought out the best and worst in the women of Paris. A few, like Violette Szabo, killed at Ravensbruck, became heroines of the Resistance. Others hid Jews at great risk to themselves. Some collaborated with the Germans, to be imprisoned and ostracised after the war' * CATHOLIC HERALD * Anne Sebba's remarkable history of the women who chose to defy the invaders, often at a terrible cost to themselves, gives an inspiring account of the courageous contribution - still too little acknowledged - of French women to the Resistance -- JANE SHILLING * DAILY MAIL * An enthralling narrative of women's reactions to German Occupation as Paris became a place of 'power, fear, aggression, courage, deprivation and secrets' . Some chose to maintain glamour no matter what, others to resist; most just coped as best they could, and this is a sympathetic look at the choices they made -- Mary S. Lovell, author of <i>THE MITFORD GIRLS</i> * THE WEEK * This fascinating account of women during the Second World War tells hard-lived stories from housewives to Resistance fighters, shop girls to celebrities. It's a brilliantly researched, untold history that asks a fundamental question: how do people make choices in war? Collaborate, resist, do the right thing at great personal risk-or just survive? -- Antonia Byatt * THE TIMES * 'Meticulously researched' -- Nicky Haslam * SPECTATOR Books of the Year * 'This is a flowing account of women's lives in extraordinary circumstances' * FAMILY TREE MAGAZINE * 'In World War II, the women of occupied Paris had to decide how to respond - should they resist? And if so, how? Sebba's compassionate, open-minded book tells some of their stories' * HISTORY REVEALED * 'Paris in the 1940s was a war-torn time of fear, power, deprivation, secrets and as ever in the French capital, glamour. Les Parisiennes explores how these years impacted on the women of the city, with character accounts from war collaborators and resisters to actresses and writers, together portraying a fascinating account of how the women of Paris lived, loved and died under the Nazi Occupation' * LIVING FRANCE magazine * 'Les Parisiennes is the story of the famous and glamorous: Coco Chanel, jewelry designer Suzanne Belperron, novelist Irene Nemirovsky, actress Simone Signoret and the daughters of the Dior, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, and de Rothschild families. The book also features a cast of ordinary women - Ravensbruck survivors, Resistance fighters and collaborators - doing their best to muddle through, keep up their physical appearances and their famous French allure during the country's darkest of days . . . The book, hard to put down, yet difficult to read in parts, is also the story of a city at its most vulnerable, and [an] intriguing insight into the importance of fashion to national self-esteem' * WOMEN'S WEAR DAILY * 'This account of the women of Paris living under the dark shadow of the Nazi occupation is a must-read' -- Sarra Manning * RED ONLINE * 'In Les Parisiennes, historian Anne Sebba explores the tough choices made during the occupation. By weaving together a range of stories - of struggling housewives, social climbers, artists and actresses - she brings alive the challenges of Les Annees Noires . . . she also demonstrates that, under occupation, life was mostly blurred lines and ethical trade-offs . . . Is a degree of collusion justified if it puts you in a position to do good? And can too great an adherance to principles be counter-productive?... Sebba concludes surviving in occupied Paris did demand some sort of decision about how best to live alongside the Germans. 'It is not for the rest of us to judge, but, with imagination, we can understand,' she says. Her sweeping, nuanced account makes it easier for us to do just that' -- Dani Garavelli * SUNDAY HERALD * 'The Nazi occupation of Paris and the violent aftermath of liberation forced women and young girls to be collaborators, resisters, bystanders or victims. Their moral dilemmas are told in Anne Sebba's poignant stories, many of them gleaned from interviews with survivors. Her theme is choice: to what extent did women passively collaborate in buying black-market food for their own children? How did so many women resist and save other people's children? Such life-and-death decisions beat at the heart of this powerful history' * SAGA magazine * 'This is a fascinating account of how women lived in Paris during the Forties. Novelist Irene Nemirovsky converted to Catholicism; the lesbian racing driver Violette Morris embraced the Nazi philosophy; Coco Chanel retreated to the Ritz with a lover. Chacun a son gout. Come liberation, of course, there was a heavy price to pay' -- Sebastian Shakespare * TATLER * 'The fruit of thorough research and interviews with survivors, this is a collage of extraordinary stories' -- Piers Paul Read * THE TABLET * 'This is the most wonderful book. It's something that you could read every night in small doses because it's packed with stories of women, both wonderful women and awful ones, aristocrats, concierges, prostitutes, actresses, they're all in here . . . The stories that you find, not just from diaries and ration books and things but actual interviews are completely riveting . . . making us think how we ourselves perhaps might behave, which is always the most interesting kind of history book . . . very moving . . . it's got everything, humour, bravery, tragedy and wonderful stories' -- Amanda Craig * MONOCLE * 'Anne Sebba's tour de force of research and reflection, Les Parisiennes, is a testament of silk and sacrifice; of choices to resist or collaborate with the Nazis; of dalliance, defiance, and survival that turned on a concierge's random kindness or a stick of gelignite strapped to the chest . . . Sebba sources first-time stories of wartime women and records tales of collaboration horizontale with real sensitivity for the 'moral ambiguity' of those who exchanged sexual favours for privileges - or survival . . . extraordinary and evocative' -- Madeleine Kingsley * JEWISH CHRONICLE * 'In the inter-war years women, who were yet to win the vote, had been encouraged to remain at home with motherhood vaunted as the ideal of womanhood. The reality of war propelled women into very different and often dangerous roles and it is these roles that Sebba explores in this powerful and moving book . . . Sebba's researches have been exhaustive: she has interviewed survivors and read countless documents' -- Vanessa Berridge * DAILY EXPRESS * 'This is an elegant, enthralling and richly illustrated account of how the female residents of the French capital survived the Second World War and its aftermath with Parisian panache' -- Caroline Sanderson * SUNDAY EXPRESS * 'The book takes an unflinching and sympathetic look at the roles women were asked to play in the war, and those they wrote for themselves . . . Sebba interviewed many of the surviving women, and tells their stories here, many for the first time . . . Les Parisiennes insists on the moral incertitude of wartime, 'especially through the eyes of women'. Perhaps because their lives were so complicated and roles so divided, they were more able to perceive, and be at home with, ambiguity . . . I am filled with admiration not only for the women themselves, but for Sebba's heroic research, for her meticulous tracking of these people and their exploits, of their fragility and their strength. This book is an important reminder of the fact that fully half of the story of the second world war is buried in memory and the archive, and has only recently been unearthed' -- Lauren Elkin * GUARDIAN * 'One of the distinctive features of Anne Sebba's richly intelligent history is her evocation of sound. Sebba has deliberately eschewed a focus on well-known primary documentation for her history of Parisian women during the Second World War, choosing instead to alert her readers to a 'quieter and frequently less well-known' set of voices. Those voices, belonging to women of all classes, ages and educational backgrounds, weep and sing through this extraordinary book . . . Sebba is adept at explaining the changing political climate of Paris as the war progressed, but she never allows politics to overshadow her subjects' voices. This book does not judge - instead, in the breadth of its humanity, it achieves some of the recognition that the Parisiennes' own heroic modesty often denied them' -- Lisa Hilton * TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT * The debate over the extent of collaboration versus the extent of resistance during the occupation is not new, but Sebba has found an enthralling way of looking at the story by focusing on how the choice was made by French women, and, in particular, by the women of Paris . . . Sebba doesn't offer an explanation as to why some women chose one course, others another, rightly letting their actions, compelling life stories - and the physiognomy of the wonderful selection of photographs - speak for themselves -- Sarah Helm * OBSERVER * 'As Anne Sebba makes clear in her fascinating book Les Parisiennes, there was no Hollywood clarity about life in the City of Light . . . there were very many reasons not to resist ... Sebba has interviewed women who, remarkably, are talking about their experiences for the first time. This is a valuable book . . . Although Sebba salutes the bravery of Les Parisiennes, she is careful not to condemn the ones who chose simply to survive . . . To read this book is to admire female bravery and resilience, but also to understand why the scars left by the Second World War still run so deep' -- Daisy Goodwin * THE TIMES * Anne Sebba has the nearly miraculous gift of combining the vivid intimacy of the lives of women during the Occupation with the history of the time. This is a remarkable book -- Edmund de Waal, author of <i>THE HARE WITH AMBER EYES</i> 'As Anne Sebba shows, life for a Parisian woman was a deeply ambiguous affair. Their experiences, like a kaleidoscope can be 'turned any number of ways to produce a different image'. Sebba's book, with its phenomenal amount of detailed research and its vast cast of characters, is rich in stories about the tricks of life under Occupation, the heroism of those who carried out acts of defiance, the slipperiness of collusion and the vast profits made by fixers, contacts, middlemen and entrepreneurs. She is particularly good on the fashion world and the scheming, equivocating social luminaries' -- Caroline Moorehead * LITERARY REVIEW * This is a fascinating book I couldn't stop reading. Anne Sebba knows everything about Paris during the war and she relates the end of all the whispered stories I've been hearing all my life. She understands everything about the chic, loathsome collaborators and the Holocaust victims, and their stories are told in an irresistible narrative flood -- Edmund White, author of <i>THE FLANEUR</i> 'Anne Sebba's fascinating and beautifully written study gives voice to a myriad of narratives belonging to the Parisian women who resisted, collaborated, flourished, suffered, died or survived through a mixture of defiance and compromise . . . Sebba skilfully weaves the history of 1940s Paris through the remarkable stories of women from all walks of life' -- Clare Mulley * SPECTATOR * Wonderfully researched, this is an important retelling of Les Annees Noires in Paris which puts women's stories, and the complications of their lives under Occupation, centre stage. Sebba reminds us that we should listen and put ourselves in their shoes, before leaping immediately to judgement, and backs this up with testimonies from many women whose voices have remained unheard -- Kate Mosse, author of <i>LABYRINTH</i> and <i>CITADEL</i></p><h2>Targeted Tracks: The Cumberland Valley Railroad in the Civil War, 1861-1865</h2><p>The Civil War was the first conflict in which railroads played a major role. Although much has been written about their role in general, little has been written about specific lines. The Cumberland Valley Railroad, for example, played an important strategic role by connecting Hagerstown, Maryland to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Its location enhanced its importance during some of the Civil War&#x2019;s most critical campaigns. Despite the line&#x2019;s significance to the Union war effort, its remarkable story remains little known. The publication of Targeted Tracks: The Cumberland Valley Railroad in the Civil War, 1861-1865, by Scott L. Mingus Sr. and Cooper H. Wingert, rectifies that oversight.<br><br>Because of its proximity to major cities in the Eastern Theater, the Cumberland Valley Railroad was an enticing target for Confederate leaders. As invading armies jostled for position, the CVRR&#x2019;s valuable rolling stock was never far from their minds. Northern military and railway officials, who knew the line was a prized target, coordinated&#x2014;and just as often butted heads&#x2014;in a series of efforts to ensure the railroad&#x2019;s prized resources remained out of enemy hands. When they failed to protect the line, as they sometimes did, Southern horsemen wrought havoc on the Northern war effort by tearing up its tracks, seizing or torching Union supplies, and laying waste to warehouses, engine houses, and passenger depots.<br><br>In October 1859, Abolitionist John Brown used the CVRR in his fateful Harpers Ferry raid. The line was under direct threat by invading Confederates during the Antietam Campaign, and the following summer suffered serious damage during the Gettysburg Campaign. In 1864, Rebel raiders burned much of its headquarters town, Chambersburg, including the homes of many CVRR employees. The railroad was as vital to residents of the bustling and fertile Cumberland Valley as it was to the Union war effort.<br><br>Targeted Tracks is grounded on the railway&#x2019;s voluminous reports, the letters and diaries of local residents and Union and Confederate soldiers, official reports, and newspaper accounts. The primary sources, combined with the expertise of the authors, bring this largely untold story to life.</p><p>Scott L. Mingus, Sr., has written nineteen Civil War books. His biography of Confederate General William &#x201c;Extra Billy&#x201d; Smith won the 2013 Nathan Bedford Forrest Southern History Award and the Dr. James I. Robertson, Jr., Literary Award, and was also nominated for the Virginia Literary Award for Non-Fiction.

He has also written six scenario books on miniature wargaming and was elected to the hobby&#x2019;s prestigious Legion of Honor. He currently lives in York, PA.<br><br>Cooper Wingert is the author of a dozen books and numerous articles on slavery and the American Civil War. His book The Confederate Approach on Harrisburg won the 2012 Dr. James I. Robertson, Jr. Literary Award for Confederate history. His other works include Slavery and the Underground Railroad in South Central Pennsylvania, Abolitionists of South Central Pennsylvania, and Harrisburg and the Civil War.

Now in their thirties, Ronny&#x2019;s trying to start a life after rodeo and booze, Kip has come back to pour stock-market millions into reviving the mill, Hank&#x2019;s followed his father into farming, and Lee&#x2019;s indie-rock career--built on his legendary DIY recording in a Little Wing chicken coop--has shot him into another social stratosphere. Nickolas Butler&#x2019;s debut novel was inspired in part by the life of his high school friend Justin Vernon, who took the 2012 Grammy for Best New Artist as Bon Iver, and despite its occasional flirtation with stereotypes, his characters and their friendships have authentic souls.

It was called, he reported, <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em>, the title inspired by Shakespeare, and it followed the travails of one Ira Stigman, whose family had just moved to New York&#x2019;s Jewish Harlem in that "ominous summer of 1914." <p>"It is like hearing that...J. D. Salinger is preparing a sequel to <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>," the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> pronounced, while <em>Vanity Fair</em> extolled Roth's new work as "the literary comeback of the century." Even more astonishing was that Roth had not just written a second novel but a total of four chronologically linked works, all part of <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em>. Dying in 1995 at the age of eighty-nine, Roth would not live to see the final two volumes of this tetralogy published, yet the reappearance of <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em>, a fulfillment of Roth's wish that these installments appear as one complete volume, allows for a twenty-first-century public to reappraise this late-in-life masterpiece, just as <em>Call it Sleep</em> was rediscovered by a new generation in 1964.</p><p>As the story unfolds, we follow the turbulent odyssey of Ira, along with his extended Jewish family, friends, and lovers, from the outbreak of World War I through his fateful decision to move into the Greenwich Village apartment of his muse and older lover, the seductive but ultimately tragic NYU professor Edith Welles. Set in both the fractured world of Jewish Harlem and the bohemian maelstrom of the Village, <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em> echoes Nabokov in its portrayal of sexual deviance, and offers a harrowing and relentless family drama amid a grand panorama of New York City in the 1910s and Roaring 20s.</p><p>Yet in spite of a plot that is fraught with depictions of menace, violence, and intense self-loathing, <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em> also contains a cathartic, even redemptive, overlay as "provocative as anything in the chapters of St. Augustine" (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>), in which an elder Ira, haunted by the sins of his youth, communes with his computer, Ecclesias, as he recalls how his family's traditional piety became corrupted by the inexorable forces of modernity. As Ira finally decides to get "the hell out of Harlem," his Proustian act of recollection frees him from the ravages of old age, and suddenly he is in his prime again, the entire telling of <em>Mercy</em> his final pronouncement.</p><p><em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em> is that rare work of fiction that creates, through its style and narration, a new form of art. Indeed, the two juxtaposed voices&#x2015;one of the "little boys swimming in a sea of glory," the other of one of those same boys "in old age being rudely swept to sea"&#x2015;creates a counterpoint, jarring yet oddly harmonious, that makes this prophetic American work such an lasting statement on the frailties of memory and the essence of human consciousness.</p><p><em>Mercy of a Rude Stream: The Complete Novels</em>&nbsp;includes <em>A Star Shines Over Mt. Morris Park</em>, <em>A Diving Rock on the Hudson</em>, <em>From Bondage</em>, and <em>Requiem for Harlem</em>.</p></p><p><p><strong>Henry Roth</strong> (1906&#x2013;1995) spent his early years on Manhattan&#x2019;s Lower East Side.

No artist of our time has been more controversial, and Pollock's reputation as the archetypal Abstract Expressionist has assumed mythic overtones. The balanced evaluation presented in this well-reasoned overview is long overdue.<br> <br></p><p>The almost mythic Jackson Pollock--a roughshod, ill-mannered, prodigiously ambitious, aggressive, alcoholic, tormented artist--is alive and unwell in this book. But Kirk Varnedoe and Pepe Karmel, the chief curator and adjunct assistant curator, respectively, of the Museum of Modern Art's Department of Painting and Sculpture, also go deeply into Pollock's art in eye-opening ways. This book is the catalog for the retrospective of Pollock's art-shattering oeuvre at the Museum of Modern Art in the fall of 1998 and includes many biographical pictures as well as color plates of Pollock's paintings, from the awkward but earnest early works to the late, great, famous canvasses. Varnedoe's essay, aptly titled "Comet: Jackson Pollock's Life and Work," deftly invites the reader into Pollock's world, starting with his country studio: "The structure, often called a barn, is in fact more like a glorified tool shed." Karmel's essay, "Pollock at Work: The Films and Photographs of Hans Namuth," is a truly groundbreaking exploration of Pollock's technique. Karmel has scrutinized every frame of every piece of film, still or moving, ever taken of Pollock painting. He arrives at absolutely original conclusions: Pollock's all-over swirls of dripped and flung paint often began as figurative works and clearly relate to such all-American stalwarts as Thomas Hart Benton. Karmel makes countless other sharp observations, noting the difference, for example, between fast-looking marks and the slow, deliberate movements with which they were made (and vice versa). His essay is a work of brilliant scholarship, written thrillingly, and it will forever change the way any serious viewer looks at Pollock's paintings. It makes this volume absolutely essential for understanding the work of this great, sad artist. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i><b>Elizabeth Frank</b> has written extensively on both art and literature, including a biography of Louise Bogan.

Millions of contemporary Christians are caught up in "rapture" fever, evidenced by the phenomenal success of the Left Behind novels. At the opposite end of the spectrum are those, such as the leaders of the Jesus Seminar, who believe that Jesus did not teach about the approaching Kingdom of God.<br><br> In God's Time offers an alternative to these two poles in the debate, an alternative that is at once faithful and sane, readable and scholarly. Author Craig C. Hill encourages Christians both to take seriously and to think sensibly about the hope of God's ultimate victory. His new book includes chapters on the nature of the Bible, the history of prophecy, the meaning of apocalyptic writings, the interpretation of Daniel and Revelation, the expectations of Jesus, and the hopes of the early Christians. It also includes an appendix ("Not Left Behind") on the subject of the rapture.<br><br> Endorsed by a wide array of top scholars and church leaders, In God's Time is a reliable guide to this often bewildering but always fascinating subject.</p><p>Craig C. Hill is research professor of theological pedagogy and executive director of D.Min. and M.A.C.P. programs at Duke University Divinity School, Durham, North Carolina.Eschatology is a hot subject. "Prophecy" is a regular feature in supermarket tabloids, and it recently made the cover of Time magazine. Interest in the subject fuels countless water cooler conversations, myriad "end-times" Web sites and the whole Left Behind publishing juggernaut. But in many quarters of the Christian community, that same intrigue over "what happens at the end of the story" is balanced by bewilderment, even embarrassment over what the Bible and its various interpreters say. For these Christians in particular (and less so for inerrantist end-time enthusiasts), this book is a welcome, comprehensive and accessible guide to exploring what the Bible says about the future. Hill, a professor of New Testament at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C., wants to show "that the idea of God's triumph is central to Christian faith and that a working knowledge of the concept is essential to an informed reading of the Bible, particularly the New Testament." He begins with a primer on biblical interpretation, then addresses prophecy throughout history, the biblical books of Daniel and Revelation, Jesus' expectations for the future and what those expectations were for the earliest Christians. The book closes with an appendix on the Rapture. It all reads like a good lecture, punctuated with summary lists, illustrative diagrams and funny asides (though some readers may find the latter off-putting). Like a well-prepared and practiced professor, Hill leads his readers through this difficult material with ease and expertise, sensitivity and a sense of humor.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sag Mal</h2><p>Sag Mal: A Introduction to German Language and Culture - Textbook only with this isbn unless specifically stated - If looking for Sag Mal with Supersite Code, search asin: 1617679658.</p><p></p><h2>Psmith in the City</h2><p>When Psmith finds himself working in the City for the pompous Mr. Bickersdyke, he makes it his mission to bring a little sweetness and light into the bank manager&#39;s life. The monocled wit with the suave manner and the chivalrous but devil-may-care attitude to life is determined not to let honest toil depress him. The consequence is a series of battles in which Bickersdyke comes off worst and Wodehouse&#39;s readers best.</p><p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (P. G. Wodehouse) was an English humorist and writer best known for his Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels. Educated at boarding schools, Wodehouse turned to writing at a young age, demonstrating great skill at humorous sketches and musical lyrics. He continued to write part-time while pursuing, at the behest of his father, a career in banking, and successfully contributed numerous pieces to Punch, Vanity Fair, and The Daily Express, among other publications. In addition to his literary work, Wodehouse was incorporated into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in recognition of his collaboration with Cole Porter on Anything Goes, his lyrics to the song Bill from Show Boat, and his work on the musicals Rosalie and The Three Musketeers.<p>While interned along with other British citizens in Germany during the Second World War, Wodehouse made a series of radio broadcasts for which he was accused of being a collaborator; and, although later cleared of the charges, he never returned to England. His work has influenced many other writers including Evelyn Waugh, Rudyard Kipling, J. K. Rowling, and John Le Carr?. P. G. Wodehouse died in 1975 at the age of 93.</p>Much of the humor of Wodehouse&#39;s novel depends on the incongruity of placing monocle and lavender glove-wearing Psmith in the mundane world of a bank. Though Davidson does a good job in creating a properly persnickety voice for Psmith, Davidson may retain too much of this same fussiness in the narration, which requires a straightforward rendering to preserve the contrast of Psmith out of his element. Otherwise, Davidson distinguishes the characters quite well, especially Bickersdyke, the all-business bank manager. (A trivia note for Wodehouse fans: though the later novel, LEAVE IT TO PSMITH, mentions that the &#34;p&#34; is silent, a glance at the text of this earlier book shows that Wodehouse seems to have initially had a different idea about the pronunciation: The protagonist and the narrator refer to him as &#34;Psmith&#34;; most other characters call him &#34;Smith.&#34; Davidson&#39;s reading correctly follows the text to a &#34;p.&#34;) G.H.

After a moderately interesting foray involving Mauryl, the aging wizard who conjures a "Shaping" named Tristen, the meandering of the nearly empty-headed Shaping takes center stage for far too long. Tristen sets off upon a quest knowing neither who he is nor what he seeks. Fortuitous happenings eventually bring him to Cefwyn, a prince in line to rule the land, and to Cefwyn's wizard, Emuin, himself a former student of Mauryl's. (The villains here are of two types: nebulously motivated men and erotically minded women.) A series of escapades involving prosaically presented political machinations leads to an inevitable final battle?and to the likelihood of a sequel. Several plot threads, such as Tristen's similarity to a golem and an invocation of the "Thirty-Eight," indicate that Cherryh is leaning on texts of Jewish mysticism here, but it's unlikely that even the most diligent of kabbalists would have the patience to wade through this substandard work. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Works of James Arminius: The London Edition (3 Volumes)</h2><p>The definitive edition of the works of James Arminius, &#34;founder&#34; of Arminian theology.

The deafening, terrible noise. The sound of air, rushing through his clothing, tearing at his hair, clawing his lips back into a grotesque grin. Ten seconds? Perhaps. Thirty-two feet per second, per second. A memory. School? Shadows. Sadness. Anger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightheaded now, lungs unable to snatch the air rushing by. Panic. The rock face a grey curtain hurtling past at one hundred and twenty miles per hour. Terminal velocity. Another memory. School? Or college? Good times. Laughter. Women. Bars. Five seconds? Terminal! <i>I&#x2019;m dying. </i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had seen the angel, a brief glimpse as he released his grip on the rock face. On life. Pure, white, beautiful. An angel that had brought him death. Angels. Heaven. Too late? Never too late, his mother said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother. Regrets. Words not spoken. Actions not taken. Taken. Birds. Fear, now. Plunging down through open space. <i> I&#x2019;m going to die. </i> Repentance. The key. <i>God, forgive me. For the birds. For&#x2014; </i><br> <br> The man watching through binoculars fixed the body&#x2019;s landing place against the scarred granite backdrop, and then swept the horizon in either direction. Nothing else stirred. He focused again on the rock face and relocated the crumpled form, remembering the sickening flat bounce as life had left it. He lowered his binoculars and sat, deep in thought, seeming not to notice the fierce buffeting of the winds that scoured the bleak landscape. After a moment, he tucked his bins into a canvas bag resting against his hip, careful not to damage the other item inside. Things had changed now, but perhaps there was still a way; and perhaps this other item, now nestling gently against the bins, held the key. He rose from his crouched position and began to make his way toward the towering presence of Sgurr Fiona. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He moved with haste over the uneven terrain, beneath a sky that was grey and leaden. Swollen rain clouds were riding inland on the onshore winds. A fierce Atlantic squall was on its way and the exposed heath would offer no shelter once the storm arrived. The man wore only a heavy fisherman&#x2019;s sweater, denim jeans, and walking shoes. He had no coat or waterproofs to ward off the horizontal rains that would soon drive across the landscape. <br> He had estimated the distance to the rock face at a quarter of a mile, and he could tell now, as he crossed the ground with his steady, purposeful gait, that he&#x2019;d been about right. Even experienced walkers underestimated distances in these parts. The stark, featureless landscape seemed to draw in the mountains on the horizon, making them appear closer. But the man had spent enough time in the natural world to be alert for its deceptions. It was those of the human world he found harder to detect. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He moved over the tussocks easily, barely noticing the sprigs of gorse and brambles that snatched like harpies at his trouser cuffs. Once or twice he stumbled over the craggy, moss-covered mounds, but for the most part his progress was sure-footed, even in the flimsy, well-worn soles of his walking shoes. On the horizon, the grey mass of a low cloudbank had begun its inexorable time-lapse march across the landscape. He would need to work quickly if he was to find shelter before the storm came. He had a window, a tiny chink of opportunity: The coming storm would discourage others from venturing out here. But squalls passed over these coastal areas quickly, chased into the inland valleys and hill passes by the relentless coastal winds. Behind the storm would come the clear white-blue skies of the North Atlantic. And then the walkers would return to the trails. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long before the body was found and reported. He must do what had to be done long before that happened. He needed to be far away by then. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last of the vegetation died away and he emerged onto a slight slope of scree that led up to the base of the rock face. Sgurr Fiona towered above him, its peaks already lost in the greyness of the clouds. He stopped for a second to take in its grandeur, and as he looked up, he paused. Until now, only the images of the death, the violent impact of the man&#x2019;s body hitting the ground, had occupied his thoughts. But the initial shock was starting to wear off,, and he began to recognize a meaning behind what he had seen; an explanation, perhaps. Had the other man recognized it, also, in those last, long terrifying seconds? Had he, too, acknowledged what it might mean? Either way, it was just him, now, standing alone on this empty, windswept heath, who possessed this wisdom, this secret, entrusted to him by another man&#x2019;s death. He looked up at Sgurr Fiona once again, but the sky below the clouds was empty. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He approached the body and forced himself to look down at the broken, rag-doll form. It was clear the man had died on impact. The damage seemed to be mostly to the head and face. It was difficult to even make out the features now. He shook his head. It was as if the fates themselves had determined to cloak the death in a double layer of mystery: not only of who the dead man was, but of what he had looked like in life. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man felt a momentary wave of sadness for the empty shape at his feet. All that was left of Jack de Laet, with whom he had drunk, and laughed, and swapped lies &#x2014; and unknowingly, a few truths too &#x2014; over the previous few weeks. He was a bad man, Jack, one of the worst. But he had been a person, a living, breathing human being. And now he was ... what? The man didn&#x2019;t have time to consider the question. Musing about the afterlife, the great beyond, was for a warm pub, where he would head after this, for a hot meal and a glass of single malt whisky and the comfort of a gently burning fire. Out here, at the base of a granite rock face, under a low, roiling, gunmetal sky, he had work to do. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knelt beside the body and slowly began to withdraw the day pack from beneath Jack de Laet&#x2019;s stiffening form. He worked with great care. He couldn&#x2019;t see any blood coming from under the body, but if there was any, he knew the small pack could disturb it, smear it, perhaps in a way that a good forensic examiner might be able to detect. He breathed a sigh of relief when the pack finally slithered free showing no traces of blood. He lifted it to one side and peered in. &#x201c;Ah Jack, you lied to me,&#x201d; he said quietly, without malice. Using a handkerchief, he withdrew a book from his canvas shoulder bag. It was battered and dog-eared, with a long-faded cover from which the images of a couple of birds, well-drawn and easily identifiable, stared back at him. He took a pen from his pocket and wrote two words on the flyleaf, holding the cover open with the handkerchief. Then he leaned forward to delicately lift the flap on one of De Laet&#x2019;s jacket pockets. He slid the book in. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He patted the pocket slightly as he closed the flap and rose from his kneeling position clutching the small day pack. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;See you soon,&#x201d; he said. But he wasn&#x2019;t talking to Jack de Laet. <br></p><h2>Treasures of the American Arts and Crafts Movement, 1890-1920</h2><p>Profiles the movement that began at the turn-of-the-century and inspired a revolution in the decorative arts</p><p>Tod M. Volpe and Beth Cathers have been collectors, dealers and scholars in the field of Arts and Crafts for many years, and Alastair Duncan is well known for his various books on aspects of Art Nouveau and Art Deco.Rejecting cheap, mass-produced items as aesthetically unappealing, the Arts and Crafts Movement integrated beauty and practicality by using quality materials and construction to create household objects with simple, straightforward designs. This book showcases these skillfully crafted objects, featuring furniture, ceramics, metal and silver, lighting and windows, and miscellaneous items in numerous beautiful illustrations. Separate chapters examine the designers, architects, and firms that offered various interpretations of the movement's philosophy. Libraries will want to consider, given the renewed interest in the craft-as-art debate.

For the next twelve years, he lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota, working as a piano player, bus boy, Civilian Conservation Corpsman, and professional basketball player before taking up photography in the late 1930s and moving to Chicago. He was awarded the first Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in photography in 1942 and chose to work with Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in Washington, D.C. During World War II, he was an Office of War Information (OWI) correspondent. </p><p>He photographed fashion for <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Glamour</i> before joining the staff of <i>Life</i> in 1949 and remained a photojournalist for the magazine until 1969. He also became famous in the late 1960s for his stories on Black revolutionaries, later incorporated into his book <i>Born Black.</i> He was a founder and editorial director of <i>Essence</i> magazine from 1970 to 1973.</p><p> His film career began in 1961 when he wrote and directed a documentary, <i>Flavio.</i> He received an Emmy Award for another documentary, <i>Diary of a Harlem Family,</i> in 1968. He produced and directed Hollywood films including <i>The Learning Tree, Shaft, Shaft's Big Score, The Super Cops,</i> and <i>Leadbelly.</i></p><p> He is first and foremost a celebrated photojournalist and fine art photographer whose work, collected and exhibited worldwide, is emblematic of American culture. In <i>A Hungry Heart,</i> he reaches into the corridors of his memory and recounts the people and events that shaped him: from growing up poor on the Kansas prairie to withstanding the unbearably cold winters of Minnesota to living on the edge of starvation in Harlem during the Depression. He more than survived the challenges and crises of his life; he thrived and has become one of the most celebrated and diversely talented figures in American culture.</p></p><p><b>Gordon Parks's</b> retrospective book of art photography, <i>Half Past Autumn,</i> published in 1997, coincided with an exhibition organized by the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., which traveled in the United States from that year until 2003, and an HBO documentary that aired on November 30, 2000. He has authored numerous books of art, fiction, memoir (including <i>A Star for Noon),</i> photographs, and a CD of his music (2000). He published <i>The Learning Tree,</i> a novel, in 1963, and three previous autobiographies, <i>A Choice of Weapons, To Smile in Autumn,</i> and <i>Voices in the Mirror.</i> He died in March 2006 at his home in Manhattan. He was 93.<b><p>Chapter One</p><p></p></b><p></p><p>Two of my close friends threw a fine birthday party for me. Two daughters, a grandson, a couple of former wives, an ex-girlfriend, old acquaintances, champagne, wine and good music filled the elegant room overlooking New York's crystal skyline. It was an evening not to be forgotten. Later, joy still coursed through my thoughts when I plumped my pillow and attempted to sleep. But no matter how I twisted and turned, sleep refused to come. Then, in the silence, one large number began roaming through the darkness. Ninety! I tried telling myself that it had nothing to do with anything, but through the leftover haze of red wine, I realized it had a lot to do with just about everything. On my next birthday I would be ninety. I had better get on with it. Later could be too late.</p><p></p><p>Since that night I have revisited the banquet that life has laid before me. What a superb feast it is! The sweetness of recognition and success, the bitterness of poverty, hunger, and bigotry overlying the rituals of existence: marriage, birth, work, seasoned with pain and joy, and most of all -- love. My mother, father, and fourteen brothers and sisters sowed love's harvest. Years after they were all gone, I ate from that harvest when I needed it. Eventually I was to learn to share their love with those who asked for no more than also to be loved.</p><p></p><p>Nostalgia blankets me when I think back over the years passed. Sometimes I knock on the door of my memory and it opens to an event that came close to denying me a future of any kind. I was born dead. But a young White doctor plunged my blood-soaked remains into a tub of icy water and miraculously gave me life. With determination he had disallowed even death to defeat him. Years later, when told about that event by an older sister, I went to give him my thanks. But by then he was dead. My mother had expressed her gratitude to him by giving me his name. Dr. Gordon was the savior whose color had nothing to do with his giving me, a Black child, a right to life.</p><p></p><p>Resting deep in the corridors of my memory is another event that helped give shape to my future, though I was only ten at the time. Just a few moments away from death, my invalid brother Leroy turned on his pillow and looked steadily into my eyes. "Pedro," he said, "you've been roughing up people lately. That ain't good. Your brain's more powerful than your fist. Try using it. You're to remember that, okay?" I stood silent. Words failed me as I gazed into the shadows beyond his bed. He reached for my hand. "Okay, Pedro?" I placed my hand on his. Then, with my tears flowing, I blurted out, "Okay! Okay!" and fled the room. His words claimed their rightful place in my upbringing, and within my heart.</p><p></p><p>I was born in a small town in the middle of the vast Kansas prairie, Fort Scott, a place touched by all the hands of nature. It bathed in lovely twilights, burned in scorching summers, froze in icy winters, and was occasionally battered by tornadoes. Fort Scott was also the mecca of bigotry, where discrimination was solidly built on the stones of segregation, in grade schools, movie houses, churches, even the graveyards. The local high school was racially integrated simply because the town fathers couldn't raise funds to build a separate one. But even there bigotry spewed its venom. Black students were denied participation in sports and social activities. It was a large school, but for them, all that space was deserted.</p><p></p><p>During those days I ate hatred, a lot of it. Yet, thanks to a caring mother and father, I also ate cabbage, cornbread, grapes, apples, strawberries, watermelon, and slaughtered hogs from a smokehouse. So I well remember what I was and what I wasn't. Still, it is impossible to forget what I lost along the way. Johnny, my best friend, writhing in a pool of blood after being shot by a jealous rival. Buster, knifed to death after a dispute over a bag of marbles. Emphry, gone after a fatal razor slashing. Then there was Kirby, the brutal White cop who carried two big guns on his hips, who earned the title "murderer" by sending a number of Black people to their graves. But thankfully, my birthplace no longer lives in yesterday alone. The present is more like an old clock with young hands moving across its face. I have reason to hope that bigotry is dead in my birthplace. I think I hear it saying, "What I am now, is not what I used to be."</p><p></p><p>Ken Lunt, my hometown's mayor, writes to me often. I'm not sure why I penned this poem for him, but I did. The local newspaper opened its editorial page for it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Homecoming</p><p></p><p>The small town into which I was born,</p><p>has, for me, grown into the largest</p><p>and most important city in the universe.</p><p>Fort Scott is not as tall, or heralded</p><p>as New York, Paris, or London -- </p><p>or other places my feet have roamed</p><p>but it is home.</p><p>Surely I remember the harsh days,</p><p>the sordid bigotry and segregated schools -- </p><p>and indeed the graveyard for Black people</p><p>(where my beloved mother and father</p><p>still rest beneath the Kansas earth).</p><p>But recently, the bitterness,</p><p>that hung around for so many years</p><p>seems to have asked for silence, for escape</p><p>from the weariness of those ugly days past.</p><p>Thankfully hatred is suddenly remaining quiet,</p><p>keeping its mouth shut! And I'm thankful</p><p>to find the contentment we lost along the way.</p><p>My hope now is that each of us can find</p><p>what GOD put us here to find -- LOVE!</p><p>Let us have no more truck with the devil!</p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><p>Long before I was born, and for more years than my father could recall, small bands of gypsies roamed the prairie towns begging for food and coins. An older brother, Clemmie, told me a story about their occasional visits to our old clapboard house. "Poppa always fumed up a bit when they came and Mama shared our food with them. 'Sarah,' he would say, 'we've hardly 'nough grub to feed our own, let alone them.' Mama's answer always shut him up. 'The poor people have to eat, Jackson. We'll make it somehow.' The gypsies always left with a basket full of food."</p><p></p><p>From Clemmie I was also to learn that she held another reason for befriending the gypsies. A Dr. Cavanaugh had told her that she would not give birth to another child. After reading her palm a gypsy woman told her differently. "You're going to have another child -- and he's going to be a very special one. Take my word for it." A couple of years later I arrived. Today I regret that Mama isn't here to know that I have tried to give truth to that prediction. Just before my sister Gladys died, she smiled and said, "Don't worry, Pedro. I'll tell Mama and Poppa about everything you're doing."</p><p></p><p>Like all of my brothers and sisters, Gladys was magnificent. At times I can't help but wonder about what she would say to them. Then comes the question I now ask myself. "What have you actually become, Pedro?" I then recollect those years when death robbed me of so many of my youthful friends. All of them had been denied the existence that I had been granted. In those years, death was working overtime. And I became obsessed with it. Fear walked beside me when I approached my mother's coffin in the middle of the night and raised the lid to take one final look at her. She seemed to be smiling, relieving me of my misery, taking my fear with her. Trembling, I lay down beside her coffin and went to sleep. The fear of death gave up and left. At dawn my father found me there on the floor, asleep.</p><p></p><p>I was only fifteen. Before death took her, Mama had persuaded Poppa to send me to live with my sister Peggy in St. Paul, Minnesota. Up there, she thought, I would escape the bitter trials of Kansas. My father hardly looked at me after the funeral. When Dan Stover's spindly taxi came to take Peggy and me to the train station he touched my shoulder and looked toward the barnyard. "Just remember your mama's teachin', son, and you'll be all right." Then he walked off to feed the hogs.</p><p></p><p>Poppa was a man of few words and, like Mama, he was fearless -- with a heart as big as a mountain. I remember when he had skin stripped from his back and thighs to cover a child who had been burned in a fire. When Mama asked him why he didn't tell her he had gone to the hospital to do that, his reply was, "It's all right, Sarah. You would have agreed to it anyhow." Years later I asked him if the child's parents came to thank him or bring him flowers. The reply was typical. "No. But I didn't do it for thanks or flowers. I did it for the child."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Winters in Minnesota were unbearably cold. The only thing I was to find colder was my brother-in-law David. From the very beginning he made it clear that I was unwelcome. Autumn was flying off leaf by leaf when I entered his house. He was a porter on a railway. It was a good house -- when he was away. When he was present everything looked at me with disdain. Ceilings and walls frowned. Doors creaked. Windows whined in the blow of frigid wind. The softest carpets turned to nails under my feet. My sister, spattered with lumps of hurt, went about in sadness and I, the intruder, was helpless to do anything to lend her comfort. It was thirty-five below zero, and Christmas was only two days away, when David and I had our confrontation. I had been invited to a party by my schoolmates, and for some reason David objected to my going. I insisted, and soon our words turned into blows, and I had him on the floor.</p><p></p><p>"Get out," he commanded, and pushed me out the door. My few clothes soon followed. I stood in the snow for a few moments, speechless. Then I picked up my clothes and moved off to face the world. I was at the bottom of it, and there was only one direction to take. That was up. "Try using your brain, Pedro. It's more powerful than your fists." Leroy's words were echoing through me, but during those terrible moments I could find nothing encouraging in them. No one could have convinced me that the next years could bring skies filled with brand-new stars. And I could not have dreamed that my world would change so much in just a few months.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2005 by Gordon Parks</p><p>...</p></p><h2>Truth, Lies, and O-Rings: Inside the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster</h2><p><b>What they didn&#x2019;t want you to know</b><br> &nbsp;<br> "We all watched in shock and disbelief when&nbsp;<i>Challenger&nbsp;</i>was lost.

With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. <br><br>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about &#x201c;The Boss from Hell.&#x201d; Narrated in Andrea&#x2019;s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda&#x2019;s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day&#x2014;and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.</p><p>It's a killer title: <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>. And it's killer material: author Lauren Weisberger did a stint as assistant to Anna Wintour, the all-powerful editor of <i>Vogue</i> magazine. Now she's written a book, and this is its theme: narrator Andrea Sachs goes to work for Miranda Priestly, the all-powerful editor of <i>Runway</i> magazine. Turns out Miranda is quite the bossyboots. That's pretty much the extent of the novel, but it's plenty. Miranda's behavior is so insanely over-the-top that it's a gas to see what she'll do next, and to try to guess which incidents were culled from the real-life antics of the woman who's been called Anna "Nuclear" Wintour. For instance, when Miranda goes to Paris for the collections, Andrea receives a call back at the New York office (where, incidentally, she's not allowed to leave her desk to eat or go to the bathroom, lest her boss should call). Miranda bellows over the line: "I am standing in the pouring rain on the <i>rue de Rivoli</i> and my driver has vanished. Vanished! Find him immediately!" <p> This kind of thing is delicious fun to read about, though not as well written as its obvious antecedent, <i>The Nanny Diaries</i>. And therein lies the essential problem of the book. Andrea's goal in life is to work for <i>The New Yorker</i>--she's only sticking it out with Miranda for a job recommendation. But author Weisberger is such an inept, ungrammatical writer, you're positively rooting for her fictional alter ego not to get anywhere near <i>The New Yorker</i>. Still, Weisberger has certainly one-upped <i>Me Times Three</i> author Alex Witchel, whose magazine-world novel never gave us the inside dope that was the book's whole <i>raison d' etre</i>. For the most part, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i> focuses on the outrageous Miranda Priestly, and she's an irresistible spectacle. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"[A] funny, biting, low-cal treat."<br>-Rush &amp; Molloy, <i>The New York Daily News</i><br><br>"A deliciously witty and gossipy first novel."<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"[An] on-the-money kiss-and-tell debut.<br><i>-Kirkus</i><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Alphabets Old and New</h2><p>1910.

With few exceptions, TV shows, movie series and entertainers all go on producing product well after their prime. The popular Web site jumptheshark.com which takes its name from the ignominious Happy Days episode in which Fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis elaborates on this truism, chronicling the moments when TV series began their slides into embarrassment. Hein, the site's creator, expands the site here, taking aim at not only TV shows, but also musicians, celebrities, athletes and politicians. It's a risky move on Hein's part because, as he himself notes, one of the first signs of a show's doom is the spin-off. The book's television chapter offers some deliciously catty pop criticism. Hein judges Family Ties, Beverly Hills 90210 and ER for fin spottings (Alex Keaton is born, Brenda goes abroad and Dr. Ross leaves, respectively). The writing is at times strangely ambivalent, as Hein's theory of entertainment entropy ensnares just about every show imaginable, even ones he obviously likes (with the exception of The Simpsons, which miraculously escapes his eye). Like a producer with a smash hit sitcom, though, Hein can't leave well enough alone and wades into deeper waters. The celebrities chapter is especially unfocused, swiping at everyone from Cher to Francis Ford Coppola. Still, it's a light and easily digested read. Fins are definitely spotted, but the book never quite jumps the shark itself.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How the Finch Stole Christmas!: A Meg Langslow Christmas Mystery (Meg Langslow Mysteries, 22)</h2><p><p><b><i>Where&#x2019;s that partridge in its pear tree?</i></b></p><br><p>It&#x2019;s Christmas time in Caerphilly, VA, and nothing is going by the book.

Richard Sakwa here unpicks the context of conflicted Ukrainian identity and of Russo-Ukrainian relations and traces the path to the recent disturbances through the events which have forced Ukraine, a country internally divided between East and West, to choose between closer union with Europe or its historic ties with Russia. In providing the first full account of the ongoing crisis, Sakwa analyses the origins and significance of the Euromaidan Protests, examines the controversial Russian military intervention and annexation of Crimea, reveals the extent of the catastrophe of the MH17 disaster and looks at possible ways forward following the October 2014 parliamentary elections. In doing so, he explains the origins, developments and global significance of the internal and external battle for Ukraine.With all eyes focused on the region, Sakwa unravels the myths and misunderstandings of the situation, providing an essential and highly readable account of the struggle for Europe&#39;s contested borderlands.</p><p>Richard Sakwa is Professor of Russian and European Politics and Head of the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Kent.

I love the flavors that make up these recipes: wild mushrooms, blue cheese, tomatoes, garlic, fennel, seafood, and, last but not least, chocolate and hazelnuts. Maybe it's the vibrant Mediterranean flavors of these dishes and maybe it's the close friends I've shared them with, but I'm convinced this menu guarantees an extraordinarily pleasant evening, especially for the cook, since much of the dinner can be accomplished in advance. To me, this blending of modern trends with traditional tastes reflects the best of informal entertaining.<br><br>While the lasagne can certainly be made with dried noodles, the variety of mushrooms produces a subtle and complex flavor that deserves the delicacy of fresh pasta. If you don't feel like making your own, many stores sell fresh sheets of pasta for lasagne. Though the entire dish can be assembled up to a day in advance, bake it shortly before serving to preserve its subtle flavor and light texture.<br><br>I love the taste of bouillabaisse, but I'm not comfortable with soup as a main course at a company dinner, and I don't like the fishy smell that permeates the house. That's why I developed this casserole, which has all the vibrant, Mediterranean flavors of the original--olive oil, garlic, saffron, leeks--and much of the same delectable seafood but requires no fish stock; only the cooking liquid from the mussels and clams is used. Garlic toast helps to sop up the delicious juices.<br><br>Though the dishes are savory and rich, this is a relatively light meal, so I offer a more substantial salad than usual before dessert. Colorful and different, it makes a striking presentation on the plate. I prefer the salad at this point in the meal, but if it works better for you, it could be served as the first course.<br><br>Dark chocolate and toasted hazelnuts are an unbeatable combination, which are here combined in an elegant presentation that is guaranteed to draw applause from even the most sophisticated of guests. The dacquoise can be completely assembled up to 24 hours before serving. Although the nut meringue layers soften slightly, the hazelnuts remain crunchy, and as with most chocolate desserts, the flavor improves overnight.<br><br>DO-AHEAD PLANNING<br><br>UP TO 2 DAYS IN ADVANCE: Make the tomato sauce base (Step 1) for the seafood casserole.<br><br>UP TO 1 DAY IN ADVANCE: Make the pasta and assemble the lasagne. Cover and refrigerate. Cook the mussels and clams and complete the sauce for the seafood casserole (Step 2). Refrigerate separately; remove about 30 minutes before you plan to cook the seafood casserole. Cook the beets for the salad and shred them; shred the carrots. Toss both with dressing. Wash and trim the watercress. Prepare the Hazelnut Dacquoise with Chocolate Cream.<br><br>UP TO 6 HOURS BEFORE SERVING: Make the Garlic Croutons to accompany the seafood casserole. Follow the instructions in Step 2 of Roquefort Caesar Salad on page 60 but use 2 loaves of French bread and 1/2 cup olive oil and do not cut the slices into cubes.<br><br>ABOUT 1 1/2 HOURS IN ADVANCE: Shred the cucumbers, toss them with dressing, and assemble the composed salads. Refrigerate.<br><br>ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE SERVING: Bake the Three-Mushroom Lasagne. Assemble the Mediterranean Seafood Casserole. Finish the casserole either before you sit down to eat the lasagne or after you clear the table from the first course.<br><br>THREE-MUSHROOM LASAGNE WITH GORGONZOLA SAUCE<br><br>12 TO 16 SERVINGS<br><br>At the original book party for Cooking for a Crowd, which was held at New York's favorite restaurant, Union Square Cafe, this is the menu that was served. Imagine my thrill when then-chef Ali Barker, Michael Romano's predecessor, kept the lasagne on the restaurant's menu for a year. For this more formal service at the party, the chef constructed individual portions of lasagne between thin rounds of homemade pasta.<br><br>2 ounces dried porcini mushrooms<br><br>2 sticks (1/2 �d) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br><br>3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil<br><br>4 large shallots, minced<br><br>2 �ds fresh white button or cremini mushrooms, minced<br><br>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon or 1/2 teaspoon dried<br><br>1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br><br>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br><br>Cayenne pepper<br><br>4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br><br>2 small garlic cloves, minced<br><br>3/4 �d fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps sliced 1/4 inch thick<br><br>1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br><br>2 cups milk<br><br>1 cup heavy cream<br><br>1/4 �d Gorgonzola dolcelatte cheese<br><br>3/4 cup freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese (about 3 ounces)<br><br>Homemade Lasagne Noodles (opposite page) or 1 package (16 ounces) lasagne noodles<br><br>1. In a medium bowl, cover the porcini with 3 cups boiling water. Let stand until softened, 20 to 30 minutes. Lift out the mushrooms; reserve the liquid. Coarsely chop the porcini. Strain the liquid through a double layer of cheesecloth and reserve 2 cups.<br><br>2. Meanwhile, in a large heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over moderately high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the minced shallots and half the minced fresh mushrooms. Saute, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms give up their liquid, it evaporates, and the mushrooms become lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Season these mushroom duxelles with half the tarragon and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper, a dash or two of cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Scrape into a bowl. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel. Repeat with 2 more tablespoons of the butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil, adding 2 more tablespoons of the shallots and the remaining minced fresh mushrooms. Season as above. Add to the bowl. Wipe out the skillet.<br><br>3. In the same large skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over moderately high heat. Add the remaining minced shallots and the garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add the shiitake and porcini mushrooms and saute, stirring frequently, for 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to moderately low and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of the reserved porcini liquid and simmer, partially covered, for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender but still slightly chewy. Uncover and cook, stirring frequently, until the remaining liquid evaporates. Season with the remaining 2 tablespoons lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Add to the mushroom duxelles and set aside.<br><br>4. In a large heavy saucepan, melt 1 stick of butter over moderate heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes without letting the flour color. Whisk in the remaining 1 cup mushroom liquid, the milk, and the cream. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, until thickened and smooth. Reduce the heat and simmer, whisking frequently, for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Whisk in the Gorgonzola and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and several dashes of cayenne.<br><br>5. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the lasagne noodles until just tender, about 1 minute after the water returns to a boil for fresh noodles, about 12 minutes for the dried variety. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Place in a bowl of cold water and, one by one, lay the noodles out in a single layer on kitchen towels to dry.<br><br>6. To assemble the lasagne, generously butter 2 large baking pans, 9 x 13 x 2 inches. If the sauce has cooled, reheat it slightly over low heat. Arrange a layer of noodles in the bottom of each dish, trimming to fit, if necessary, and overlapping the edges only slightly. Spread a thin layer of mushrooms over the noodles (using one-quarter of the total amount in each pan) and drizzle about 1 cup of sauce over the mushrooms in each pan. Repeat with another layer of noodles, mushrooms, and sauce. Top with a final layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the noodles, dividing evenly, and divide the remaining 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the tops. Dot each with 1 tablespoon butter. (The lasagne can be assembled completely and refrigerated, covered, overnight or frozen for up to 2 weeks.)<br><br>7. Heat the oven to 375�F. Bake the lasagne (thawed, if frozen) uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes, until heated through and lightly browned on top.<br><br>HOMEMADE LASAGNE NOODLES<br><br>MAKES ABOUT 3/4 POUND , ENOUGH FOR 2 PANS OF LASAGNE<br><br>Though you can roll out pasta dough by hand with a heavy rolling pin (I did it for years), it takes muscle.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, in two batches, combine the eggs and flour. Process until well blended and the mixture resembles coarse sand. Turn out the dough and knead into a ball. Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and a kitchen towel to keep it moist.<br><br>2. Tear off lemon-size pieces of dough to work with. Keep the remaining dough covered until you are ready for it. Pass the piece of dough through the widest setting on the pasta machine. Fold the dough in thirds like a letter and pass through the same setting. Repeat two more times to complete the kneading of the dough. Then pass the dough through consecutively smaller settings until it is rolled through the thinnest setting.<br><br>3. Drape the dough over a rack (or the back of a chair) to dry for at least 20 minutes. Trim into manageable 6-to 8-inch lengths before cooking.

Hierarchy is so poorly regarded that many able people shy away from joining large companies. . . . My purpose is to change the way your company is run. . . . Therefore, this book is offered as a challenge to chief executives, boards of directors, top executives, middle managers, business academics, consulting firms, gurus, and B-school graduates to find the best way for particular companies to switch from managing with authority to leading people.At least since World War II, "command and control" has been the dominant model for running organizations, but this concept is being seriously reconsidered today. Bower sums up over 60 years of experience with McKinsey &amp; Co.?an international management consulting firm?with personal advice on how to run a business built on a network of leaders. His background qualifies him to comment on such business strategies as leading vs. commanding, developing leaders and leadership teams, and leading governing boards. The author is a straight shooter, offering a legitimate alternative to the massive leadership hype that fills the shelves these days. Recommended for academic and larger public libraries.?Dale F.

Vividly portraying the arrival of the White Buffalo Woman on the Plains, the paintings and charcoals by Vera Louise Drysdale highlight dramatic elements of the ancient rituals she imparted, and they show everyday objects that were sanctified in the Sioux cosmology.</p> <p>The sacred pipe is the central instrument in the holy rites of the Sioux people. The White Buffalo Woman appeared on the Plains to give the pipe to the Sioux so that they might "send their voices" to Wakan-Tanka, the Great Spirit. She related the seven rites of the pipe: the keeping of the soul, the rite of purification, crying for a vision, the Sun Dance, the making of relatives, preparation for womanhood, and the throwing of the ball that symbolizes the earth and gives strength to future generations.</p> <p>In this volume the rituals are condensed, but the continuity of Joseph Epes Brown&#x2019;s text is preserved. The original text, as given by Black Elk, was recorded in 1947; in 1953 the University of Oklahoma Press published it as <em>The Sacred Pipe.</em></p></p><p><p><strong>Vera Louise Drysdale</strong>, a professional artist and illustrator with numerous Indian portraits to her credit, worked for five years on the illustrations for <em>The Gift of the Sacred Pipe</em></p><br><br><p><strong>Joseph Epes Brown</strong> (1920-2000) was an American scholar whose lifelong dedication to Native American traditions helped bring the study of American Indian religious traditions into higher education. His book, <em>The Sacred Pipe</em>, is an account of his discussions with the Lakota holy man, Black Elk. "I traveled among many of the prairie Indians," Brown said, "and after meeting the old Sioux priest Black Elk, I was asked by him to record the account he should give me of his ancient religion.

A vulnerable yet thoughtful person shadowed by what he refers to as life after the Catastrophe, he finds himself celebrating &#34;depression&#34;, discovering how it is an essential emotion housing insight into the self, society, and world affairs. Amusing, disturbing and thought provoking, the novella reveals in remarkable depth the many faces of depression. The psychoanalyst agonizes over the increasingly fascist dimensions of his profession and provides an excoriating critique of the psychotropic movement. He challenges the world of modern psychology that by stereotyping souls as sufferers of one or another of the newly coined diagnoses, such as Attention Deficit Disorder, ordains a world that reduces humanity. Where thoughtfulness once was, now one discovers a pill, a fashionable new illness, and a twelve-step program that define a life. The arrival of a terrorist in his consulting room seeking treatment in order to carry out a suicide bombing serves as a pivot for other crises that involve the analyst in an increasingly anarchic and surreal era, one that suggests a new world order. Readers will find in this work new perspectives that challenge many assumptions, ironically suggesting that in these difficult times understanding our complex mental lives - as in depression - holds invaluable keys to a better future for the individual and for modern society.</p><p></p><h2>King Blood (Armchair Detective Library)</h2><p>Ike King, a man who built his empire with blood and violence, faces a career change when his sons threaten to take that empire away from him.

His latest, Interstate, is equally distinctive and imaginative in portraying human peculiarities and the search for order in the seemingly irrational and meaningless contemporary American universe. The novel brilliantly explores the alterations of memory, trauma and guilt in parents whose children have been casualties of violence. Like all of Dixon's work, it is a demanding read; the edgy, insistent, run-on dialogue, in particular, requires focused attention. The story is told eight times. While the inciting incident remains the same, with each retelling, new dimensions are added to or subtracted from the plot and characters. The question Dixon raises is what really haunts us: What would you do if the unthinkable happened? The critical event is this: a father is driving home on the highway with his little girls in the back seat; some men in a minivan drive up alongside and shoot through the window, killing one of the girls. In offering different scenarios from this point on, Dixon challenges the reader to leap imaginatively into the experience. One father risks his marriage, his relationship with his remaining child and his freedom to find the killer. Another makes his dead child's memory into a religion, praying the hospital will tell him "she's saved," although he knows she's dead. With each variation Dixon implicitly asks: How can you be sure the incident happened the way you remember, or the way you've been told? Reading Interstate is like being a passenger in a car speeding along the highway of the mind, swerving in and out of what is real and imagined, on the edge of losing control yet not losing it, because the driver knows what he's doing. With characteristic directness, Dixon's crisis-mode narrative runs together in one seemingly jumbled, breathless rush, with evocative thoughts causing memories to surface not just in the minds of the narrators but in the reader's mind as well. Jarringly perceptive and darkly compelling, this novel will confirm Dixon as a writer of stature.

Out of the Way!</h2><p>A young boy spots a baby tree growing in the middle of a dusty path in his village. He carefully places rocks around it as the local mango seller rushes past shouting, Out of the way! Out of the way!&#x201d; As the tree grows bigger, people and animals traverse the path until it becomes a lane, flowing like a river around the tree getting out of its way. Over time, the lane becomes a road, and a young man crossing the road with his children remembers the baby tree from long ago. By the time he is an old man, the tree has become a giant. The city traffic continues to rattle past, noisier and busier than ever, but sometimes the great tree works its magic, and people just stop, and listen.<br><br>In this simple, lyrical story, a wide-spreading tree and a busy road grow simultaneously, even as time passes and the footsteps of people and animals give way to speeding cars, buses and trucks.

A beautiful tribute to the architecture of the New York Public Library. Well illustrated with photographs by Anne Day. xiv, 288, 2 pages. cloth, dust jacket.. small 4to..</p><p>The New York Public Library is recognized as one of the finest examples of Beaux-Arts Classicism in the city. Reed's monograph contains a wealth of information about the building's design, from the majestic Corinthian portico on Fifth Avenue to the desk lamps in the Main Reading Room. Each architectural detail is lovingly photographed and labelled, providing an exhaustive record of the building's ornamentation. For Reed, however, architecture is style and form, nothing more; this is unfortunate, for little attention is paid to the building's construction or to the extensive stacks that house the majority of the library's books. Despite this shortcoming, the book should be of interest both to architectural historians and to the thousands of readers who make regular use of this unique resource. H. Ward Jandl, National Park Svce., Washington, D.C.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Visitors to the New York Public Library's main reading room are not likely to gaze enraptured at ornamental moldings, cherubs and vast, uninterrupted ceilings as they cope with poor lighting, uncomfortable chairs and often slow service. Reed's room-by-room architectural tour, a panegyric to the Fifth Avenue building, asks us to believe it is "a people's palace," even though its ornate turn-of-the-century style modeled on classical Paris and Rome has the effect of intimidating rather than welcoming library users. No staircase, lamp, carved relief or marble bust is overlooked as the author pores over "this great jewel of the civic crown" in belabored prose, although his armchair tour does turn up many delightful facets of the building that are probably missed by most visitors. The impressive photographs make the book. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>By Its Cover (Thorndike Press Large Print Mystery)</h2><p>Investigating the thefts of rare book pages from a prestigious Venetian library, Commissario Guido Brunetti is stymied by numerous possible suspects and the murder of a seemingly harmless theologian.

Hampe introduces the core of the book with a section, integral to the rest of the text, that includes an insightful discussion of verisimilitude in the documentary. The section launches the discussions of the preproduction (developing ideas, writing at various stages, scheduling, etc.), production (recording picture and sound, directing, interviewing, etc.), and postproduction (preparation, editing, and the wrap) phases of filmmaking. As in most expository works, the author uses examples throughout; Hampe increases their effect by having them illustrate multiple principles. His use of examples defines his taste as well: <i>An American Family</i> (the television "drama" about the Loud family) interestingly exemplifies ineffective documentary filmmaking. Knowing his preferences is extremely useful to a filmmaker in formulating his or her own values.

In addition, translations of nearly seventy administrative documents are provided, thereby enabling students of Japanese history reconstruct the invasions using contemporary sources.

Covering nearly seventy years of movie history, these side-splitting spoofs show that there&#39;s no film so sacred that it can&#39;t be treated irreverently, no movie star so famous that he or she can&#39;t be made fun of, and no script so dramatic that it can&#39;t be twisted to show its amusing side. Their scintillating wit and gut-busting brilliance make the silver screen look dull by comparison.</p><p></p><h2>Classic Natural History Prints: Plants</h2><p>Reproductions of full color botanical prints published over 340 years, mainly eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p><p></p><h2>Understanding the Book of Hebrews: The Story Behind the Sermon</h2><p><p>In this work, Kenneth Schenck re-presents the complex argument of Hebrews in terms of the salvation story it tells.

Including work written under her pseudonym, Megan Lindholm. Bingtown heiresses rub shoulders in this wonderful collection with vampires and alien musicians, tramps and feral cats. In The Homecoming, Lady Carillion Carrock and a number of other Jamaillian nobles are sailing to the Cursed Shores. Their journey is not by choice: for plotting against the Satrap, their wealth has been confiscated and they have been exiled. Until now, Carillion has done nothing but lead a life of privilege. She believes they are bound for wondrous cities, cities where ancient kings and queens dusted their skin with gold and wore jewels above their eyes. But when she is marooned by the ship&#39;s unscrupulous captain, she will soon discover the grim reality of what survival in the Rain Wilds entails. The Silver Lady is a would-be writer, ekeing out a dull existence by working in a Sears store. The one day a man comes in: fortyish, pleasant-looking. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except he says his name is Merlin, and he&#39;s about to change her life. Rosemary got involved with the wrong man. Pell is lazy, good for nothing, a bully. Her best friend Hilia knew it and so did her tom cat, Marmalade. But love is blind: Rosemary had Pell&#39;s baby, renovated the cottage his grandfather left in his will, turned its land to good use; and then he left her for another woman. Now he&#39;s back, and something must be done!</p><p>Megan Lindholm (Wizard of the Pigeons) writes tightly constructed SF and fantasy with a distinctly contemporary feel. Robin Hobb (Assassin's Quest) writes sprawling, multi-volume fantasies set in imaginary realms. These two writers, apparently so different, are, of course, the same person, each reflecting an aspect of a single multifaceted imagination.Inheritance gathers the best of Hobb and Lindholm's shorter fiction into one irreplaceable volume containing ten stories and novellas (seven by Lindholm, three by Hobb), together with a revealing introduction and extensive, highly readable story notes. The Lindholm section leads off with the Hugo and Nebula-nominated novella &#x201c;A Touch of Lavender,&#x201d; a powerful account of love, music, poverty, and addiction set against an extended encounter between human and alien societies. Other memorable entries include &#x201c;Cut,&#x201d; a reflection on the complex consequences of freedom, and the newly published &#x201c;Drum Machine,&#x201d; an equally absorbing meditation on the chaotic nature of the creative impulse. Two of Robin Hobb's contributions revisit the world of her popular Live Traders series. &#x201c;Homecoming&#x201d; enlarges the earlier history of those novels through the journal entries of Lady Carillion Carrock, while &#x201c;The Inheritance&#x201d; concerns a disenfranchised young woman who comes to understand the true nature of her grandmother's legacy. And in &#x201c;Cat's Meat,&#x201d; a long and wonderful story written expressly for this collection, an embattled single mother reclaims her life with the help of a gifted&#x2014;and utterly ruthless&#x2014;cat.Inheritance offers the best of two separate but related fictional worlds. Whatever their differences, the Hobb and Lindholm stories have certain crucial elements in common: their intelligence, their attention to detail, and their instant, almost effortless accessibility. Together, these beautifully crafted tales constitute a unique&#x2014;and important&#x2014;collection that offers both offers both intellectual pleasure and pure narrative excitement on virtually every page.<p>A treasure trove of tales from a master storyteller&#x2014;the first to feature works written under both her pseudonyms, Robin Hobb and Megan Lindholm . . .</p><p><em>The Inheritance</em></p><p>Before she became an acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, Robin Hobb received resounding critical praise for work written under the name Megan Lindholm.

It is a discussion of the Ten Commandments from the point of view of economic theory. Gary&#39;s discussion of the sabbath in this book supersedes everything he has written in the past, and nobody who wants to deal with the sabbath issue can afford to ignore the questions he raises in this book. So far, there has been no detailed response from strict sabbatarians, although the book was published in 1986.</p><p>This books is a detailed look at the Ten Commandments and their social, political, and economic implications. These commandments set forth a strategy of dominion.The Ten Commandments <p>There can be little doubt that the Ten Commandments made possible the development of Western Civilization. There is almost equally little doubt that Western Civilization made possible the development of free market capitalism. The question must then be raised: What was it about the Ten Commandments which made possible the development of capitalism in the West, and nowhere else (except in cultures influenced by an already capitalistic West)? </p><p>It was not some hypothetical (an non-existent) universal natural law, or "natural law rightly understook," which made possible the development of the free market, but rather biblical law and a biblical concept of linear time. It was Western man's confidence in the validity of the Ten Commandments which alone created free market institutions in world history. </p><p>Is it therefore not sufficient to ask: Is capitalism Christian? It is not sufficient to answer that the ethics of Christianity is generally in accordance with the ethics of capitalism. It is not sufficient to appeal to natural law in the Christian West as the foundation of capitalism. What must be asked is a far more controversial question: Is orthodox, Bible-based Christianity inherently capitalistic? In other words, in cultures where the Bible is preached from Genesis to Revelation, will there be an innate tendency for that culture to adopt a free market economy? Therefore, is socialism inherently heretical biblically? Gary North answers, "yes." </p><p>As secular humanism has steadily expanded its influence over the thinking of the West, especially the thinking of the intellectuals, the assault on free market capitalism has escalated. Humanism's denial of God's providence, God's law, and God's redeeming grace has created faith in a New World Order, a world in which elite central planners will direct a world-wide economic system. This is the society of Satan. </p><p>The Sinai Strategy is a detailed look at the Ten Commandments and their social, political, and, especially, economic implications. These commandments set forth a strategy of dominion. The war between capitalism and socialism is ultimately a war between God and Satan. Far too many compromised Christians have not recognized the nature of this ethical and institutional war, and they have sided with the socialists. Dr. North has drawn the dividing line between the humanists and the Christians, and between Christians themselves. Will it be God's law or Satan's, Christ's New World Order (inaugurated at Calvary) or Satan's New World Order (scheduled for the year 2000)?</p></p><h2>The Soloist: A Lost Dream, an Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music</h2><p>An intimate portrait of gifted violinist Nathaniel Ayers traces his promising education at Juilliard, his struggles with schizophrenia, and the factors that led to his homelessness in Los Angeles, circumstances that prompted their friendship and the author&#39;s efforts to improve the musician&#39;s life in spite of numerous setbacks.</p><p><b>Steve Lopez</b> is a columnist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, where he first wrote a series of enormously popular columns about Nathaniel Ayers.<b>Preface</b><p><i>I'm on foot</i> in downtown Los Angeles, hustling back to the office with another deadline looming. That's when I see him. He's dressed in rags on a busy downtown street corner, playing Beethoven on a battered violin that looks like it's been pulled from a&nbsp;dumpster.</p><p>"That sounded pretty good," I say when he&nbsp;finishes.</p><p>He jumps back three steps, eyeing me with suspicion. I see the name Stevie Wonder carved into the face of the violin, along with felt&#x2013;pen&nbsp;doodles.</p><p>"Oh, thank you very much," he says, obviously flattered. "Are you&nbsp;serious?"</p><p>"I'm not a musician," I answer. "But yes. It sounded good to&nbsp;me."</p><p>He is black, just beyond fifty, with butterscotch eyes that warm to the compliment. He is standing next to a shopping cart heaped over with all his belongings, and yet despite grubby, soiled clothing, there's a rumpled elegance about him. He speaks with a slight regional accent I can't place. Maybe he's from the Midwest or up near the Great Lakes, and he seems to have been told to always stand up straight, enunciate, carry himself with pride and respect&nbsp;others.</p><p>"I'm trying to get back in shape," he says. "But I'm going to get back in there, playing better. I just need to keep&nbsp;practicing."</p><p>"So you like Stevie Wonder?" I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>"Oh, yes, certainly. 'You Are the Sunshine of My Life.' 'My Cherie Amour.' I guess I shouldn't have written his name on my violin,&nbsp;though."</p><p>I write a column for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. The job is a little like fishing. You go out and drop a line, cast a net. I'm figuring this vagrant violinist is a column. Has to&nbsp;be.</p><p>"I'm in a hurry at the moment," I tell him, "but I'd like to come back and hear you play&nbsp;again."</p><p>"Oh, all right," he says, smiling appreciatively but with trepidation. He looks like a man who has learned to trust no&nbsp;one.</p><p>"Do you always play in this spot?" I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>"Yes," he says, pointing across the street with his bow to Per&#x2013;shing Square, in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. "I like to be near the Beethoven statue for&nbsp;inspiration."</p><p>This guy could turn out to be a rare find in a city of undiscovered gems, fiddling away in the company of Beethoven. I would drop everything if I could, and spend a few hours pulling the story out of him, but that will have to wait for another day. I've got another column lined up and not much time to shape it. The deadlines come at you without mercy, even in your&nbsp;dreams.</p><p>"I'll be back," I&nbsp;say.</p><p>He nods&nbsp;indifferently.</p><p>Back at the office I sweat out another column, scan the mail and clear the answering machine. I make a note on the yellow legal pad where I keep a list of&nbsp;possibilities.</p><p>Violin&nbsp;Man.</p><p>It's got potential. Who knows where it will&nbsp;go?</p><p>Part One</p><p>1</p><p><i>I can't get the image</i> out of my head, this odd picture of grubby refinement. But when I go back to look for the violinist in Per&#x2013;shing Square, I come up empty. His disappearance only makes the mystery more&nbsp;provocative.</p><p>Who was he? Where did he go? What is his&nbsp;story?</p><p>Three weeks later, he's back, reappearing in the same spot, and I watch from across the street for a while before approaching. His playing is a little scratchy and tentative, but just like before, it's clear this is no beginner. There'd been some serious training in there, somewhere along the way. He doesn't appear to be playing for money, which seems strange for a homeless guy. He plays as if he's a student, oblivious to everyone around him, and this is a practice&nbsp;session.</p><p>Strange place to practice. The ground shakes when buses roar by, and his strings are barely audible in the orchestra of horns, trucks and sirens. I gaze at the tops of buildings adorned with gargoyles and grand cornices. Men and women move about, duty&#x2013;bound, &#x2013;ignoring him for the most part as they disappear around corners and into entryways. The man plays on, a lone fiddler. He throws his head back, closes his eyes, drifts. A portrait of tortured&nbsp;bliss.</p><p>When he pauses, I move&nbsp;in.</p><p>"Hello," I&nbsp;say.</p><p>He jumps back, startled just as&nbsp;before.</p><p>"Do you remember me?" I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>"I remember your&nbsp;voice."</p><p>He's still suspicious of me, suspicious of everything around him, it seems. He says he was trying to remember a Tchaikovsky piece he once knew quite well, but now it is as elusive as the meaning of a dream. It's obvious that he's troubled in some way, like so many others who wander the streets as if they inhabit a different planet than the rest of us, wrapped in many&#x2013;layered outfits to keep from coming unraveled. He's wearing a ratty blue sweater with a light brown T&#x2013;shirt over it and the collar of a shirt spilling out over the top of it all. Wrapped around his neck, like a scarf, is a yellow terry&#x2013;cloth towel. His pants hang low on his waist, fitted for a man three sizes bigger, and his grimy white sneakers have no&nbsp;laces.</p><p>He tells me his name is Nathaniel Anthony Ayers. From Cleveland. He's going to keep practicing until he's proud of what he hears, he says, and I tell him I might like to write about him for the <i>L.A.&nbsp;Times</i>.</p><p>"Seriously?" he asks. "You'd really want to write about&nbsp;me?"</p><p>"Why not?" I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>He's a handsome guy, lean and fit&#x2013;looking, with a strong jaw and clean white teeth. He reminds me a little of Miles Davis. I ask where he lives and he says at the Midnight Mission, one of the biggest rescue operations on nearby Skid Row. Not inside, he specifies. But on the street, though he showers and takes some meals&nbsp;inside.</p><p>"Why not sleep&nbsp;inside?"</p><p>"Oh, no," he says. "I wouldn't want to do&nbsp;that."</p><p>I wonder how safe it can be for a man trying to reconnect with Tchaikovsky as drug dealers, prostitutes and hustlers work streets teeming with the lame and the afflicted. Skid Row is a dumping ground for inmates released from the nearby county jail, and it's a place where the sirens never stop&nbsp;screaming.</p><p>"Maybe I'll come by and visit you at the mission," I tell&nbsp;him.</p><p>He nods, but I can see he doesn't trust me. He tucks the violin back under his chin, eager to get back to his music, and I know that if this one ever pans out, it's going to take some time. I'll have to check back with him now and again until he's comfortable enough to open up. Maybe I could go on his rounds with him over the course of a day or so, see if anyone can help fill in the blanks in his story or explain his condition. As he begins to play, I wave good&#x2013;bye, and he responds with a suspicious glance in my general&nbsp;direction.</p><p>Two weeks later, I go looking for him once more and he's disappeared again. I stroll over to the mission at Fourth and Los Angeles streets, where I see street people by the dozens, some of them drug&#x2013;ravaged, some of them raving mad, some of them lying so still on the pavement it's hard to tell whether they're napping or waiting for a ride to the&nbsp;morgue.</p><p>I check with Orlando Ward, the public information man at the Midnight. He tells me he's seen the violinist around, but doesn't know the backstory. And he hasn't seen him&nbsp;lately.</p><p>Now I'm worried that I've lost the&nbsp;column.</p><p>Weeks go by and I get distracted by other things, shoveling whatever I can find into that empty space on the page. And then one day while driving to work from my home in Silver Lake, a neighborhood five miles northwest of downtown, I cut through the Second Street tunnel and there he is, putting on a one&#x2013;man concert in a location even noisier than the last&nbsp;one.</p><p>He remembers me this&nbsp;time.</p><p>"Where have you been?" I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>He says he's been around, here and there. Nowhere&nbsp;special.</p><p>A car whooshes by and his mind&nbsp;reels.</p><p>"Blue car, green car, white car," he says. "There goes a police car, and God is on the other side of that&nbsp;wall."</p><p>I nod, not knowing what to say. Maybe he's a little more unreachable than I realized. Do I take notes for a column, or do I make a few calls to see if someone can come and help&nbsp;him?</p><p>"There goes Jacqueline du Pr�," Nathaniel says, pointing at a woman a block away. "She's really&nbsp;amazing."</p><p>I tell him I doubt that it's the late cellist, who died in&nbsp;1987.</p><p>Nathaniel says he isn't so&nbsp;sure.</p><p>"I don't know how God works," he tells me sincerely, with an expression that says anything is&nbsp;possible.</p><p>I scribble that down in my notebook, and I also copy what he's written on his shopping cart with a Magic&nbsp;Marker:</p><p>"Little Walt Disney Concert Hall&#x2014;Beethoven."</p><p>I ask Nathaniel if he has moved to this location to be near the concert hall and he says no, he isn't even sure where Disney Hall is,&nbsp;exactly.</p><p>"Is it around here?" he&nbsp;asks.</p><p>"Right up the hill. The great big silvery building that looks like a&nbsp;schooner."</p><p>"Oh, that's it?"</p><p>He says he moved to this spot because he could see the Los Angeles Times&nbsp; Building two blocks away.</p><p>"Don't you work there?" he&nbsp;asks.</p><p>Having lived in Cleveland, New York and Los Angeles, &#x2013;Nathaniel tells me, it's reassuring to be able to look up at the L.A. Times Building and know where he&nbsp;is.</p><p>He plays for a while; we talk for a while, an experience that's like dropping in on a dream. Nathaniel takes nonsensical flights, doing figure eights through unrelated topics. God, the Cleveland Browns, the mysteries of air travel and the glory of Beethoven. He keeps coming back to music. His life's purpose, it seems, is to arrange the notes that lie scattered in his&nbsp;head.</p><p>I notice for the first time that his violin, caked with grime and a white chalky substance that looks like a fungus, is missing an important component or&nbsp;two.</p><p>"Your violin has only two strings," I say. "You're missing the other&nbsp;two."</p><p>Yes, he says. He's well&nbsp;aware.</p><p>"All I want to do is play music, and the crisis I'm having is right here. This one's gone," he says of the missing top string, "that one's gone, and this little guy's almost out of&nbsp;commission."</p><p>His goal in life, Nathaniel tells me, is to figure out how to replace the strings. But he got used to playing imperfect instruments while taking music classes in Cleveland's public schools, and there's a lot you can do, he assures me, with just two&nbsp;strings.</p><p>I notice while talking to him that someone has scrawled names on the pavement where we're standing. Nathaniel says he did it with a rock. The list includes Babe Ruth, Susan, Nancy, Kevin and&nbsp;Craig.</p><p>"Whose names are those?" I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>Oh, those people, he&nbsp;says.</p><p>"Those were my classmates at&nbsp;Juilliard."</p></p><h2>Scooby-doo Mysteries #18: Scooby-doo And The Caveman Caper</h2><p>Daphne is delighted when she gets the chance to skate with Olympic figure skater Betty Kunkle, but when Betty&#39;s skates disappear, Scooby and the gang investigate and are surprised by the apparently prehistoric nature of the thief.</p><p></p><h2>Across the Border (Orphans&#39; Journey, 4)</h2><p>Through prayer, thirteen-year-old Ethan meets the challenges of moving with his adopted family to a homestead in Mexico</p><p></p>
